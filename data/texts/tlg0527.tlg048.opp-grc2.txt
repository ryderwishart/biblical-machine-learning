HCAIAC προφήτης ιγ΄ Ὅρασις ἥν εἶδεν Ἠσαίας υἱὸς Ἀμώς, ἥν εἶδεν κατὰ τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ κατὰ Ἰερουσαλήμ, ἐν βασιλείᾳ Ὀζίου καὶ Ἰωαθὰμ καὶ Ἀχὰς καὶ Ἐζεκίου οἳ ἐβασίλευσαν τῆς Ἰουδαίας.
Ἄκουε, οὐρανέ, καὶ ἐνωτίζου, γῆ, ὅτι Κύριος ἐλάλησεν.
υἱοὺς ἐγέννησα καὶ ὕψωσα, αὐτοὶ δέ με ἠθέτησαν.
ἔγνω βοῦς τὸν κτησάμενον καὶ ὄνος τὴν φάτνην τοῦ κυρίου αὑτοῦ·
Ἰσραὴλ δέ με οὐκ ἔγνω, καὶ ὃ λαός με οὗ συνῆκεν.
οὐαὶ ἔθνος ἁμαρτωλόν, λαὸς πλήρης ἁμαρτιῶν, σπέρμα πονηρόν, υἱοὶ ἄνομοι.
ἐγκατελίπετε τὸν κύριον καὶ παρωργίσατε τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
τί ἔτι πληγῆτε προστιθέντες ἀνομίαν;
πᾶσα κεφαλὴ εἷς πόνον καὶ πᾶσα καρδία εἷς λύπην.
ἀπὸ ποδῶν ἔως κεφαλῆς, οὔτε τραῦμα οὔτε μώλωψ οὔτε πληγὴ φλεγμαίνουσα, οὐκ ἔστιν μάλαγμα ἐπιθεῖναι οὔτε ἔλαιον οὔτε καταδέσμους.
ἡ γῆ ὑμῶν ἕρημος, αἶ πόλεις ὑμῶν πυρίκαυστον τὴν χώραν ὑμῶν ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἀλλότριοι κατεσθίουσιν αὐτήν, καὶ ἠρήμωται κατεστραμμένη ὑπὸ λαῶν ἀλλοτρίων.
ἐγκαταλειφθήσεται ἦ θυγάτηρ Σιὼν ὡς σκηνὴ ἐν ἀμπελῶνι, καὶ ὡς ὀπωροφυλάκιον ἐν σικυηράτῳ, ὥς πόλις πολιορκουμένη·
καὶ εἶ μὴ Κύριος σαβαὼθ ἐγκατέλιπεν ἡμῖν σπέρμα, ὡς Σόδομα ἂν ἐγενήθημεν, καὶ ὡς Γόμορρα ἂν ὡμοιώθημεν.
Ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου, ἄρχοντες Σοδόμων·
προσέχετε νόμον θεοῦ, λαὸς Γομόρρας.
τί ἐμοὶ πλῆθος τῶν θυσιῶν ὑμῶν;
λέγει Κύριος·
πλήρης εἰμὶ ὁλοκαυτωμάτων κριῶν, καὶ στέαρ ἀρνῶν καὶ αἷμα ταύρων καὶ τράγων οὐ βούλομαι, οὐδ' ἂν ἔρχησθε ὀφθῆναί μοι.
τίς γὰρ ἐξεζήτησεν ταῦτα ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν;
πατεῖν τὴν αὐλήν μου οὐ προσθήσεσθε·
ἐὰν φέρητέ μοι σεμίδαλιν, μάταιον·
θυμίαμα, βδέλυγμά μοί ἐστιν·
τὰς νουμηνίας ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ σάββατα καὶ ἡμέραν μεγάλην οὐκ ἀνέχομαι·
νηστείαν καὶ ἀργείαν καὶ τὰς νουμηνίας ὑμῶν καὶ τὰς ἑορτὰς ὑμῶν μισεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου·
ἐγενήθητέ μοι εἷς πλησμονήν, οὐκέτι ἀνήσω τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν.
ὅταν τὰς χεῖρας ἐκτείνητε πρός με, ἀποστρέψει) τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου ἀφ’ ὑμῶν·
καὶ ἐὰν πληθύνητε τὴν δέησιν, οὐκ εἰσακούσομαι ὑμῶν, αἱ γὰρ χεῖρες ὑμῶν αἵματος πλήρεις.
λούσασθε, καθαροὶ γένεσθε, ἀφέλετε τὰς πονηρίας ἀπὸ τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν ἀπέναντι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου·
παύσασθε ἀπὸ τῶν πονηριῶν ὑμῶν, μάθετε καλὸν ποιεῖν, ἐκζητήσατε κρίσιν, ῥύσασθε ἀδικούμενον, κρίνατε ὀρφανῷ καὶ δικαιώσατε χήραν.
καὶ δεῦτε καὶ διελεγχθῶμεν, λέγει Κύριος·
καὶ ἐὰν ὦσιν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ὑμῶν ὡς φοινικοῦν, ὡς χιόνα λευκανῶ, ἐὰν δὲ ὦσιν ὡς κόκκινον, ὡς καὶ τὰς ἔριον λευκανῶ.
καὶ ἐὰν θέλετε καὶ εἰσακούσητέ μου, τὸ.
ἀγαθὰ τῆς γῆς φάγεσθε·
ἐὰν δὲ μὴ θέλητε μηδὲ εἰσακούσητέ μου, μάχαιρα ὑμᾶς κατέδεται·
τὸ γὰρ στόμα Κυρίου ἐλάλησεν ταῦτα.
Πῶς ἐγένετο πόρνη πόλις πιστὴ Σιών, πλήρης κρίσεως;
ἐν ᾖ δικαιοσύνη ἐκοιμήθη ἐν αὐτῇ, νῦν δὲ φονευταί.
τὸ ἀργύριον ὑμῶν ἀδόκιμον·
αἱ πόλεις ὑμῶν πυρίκαυστοι οἶ κάπηλοί σου μίσγουσιν τὸν οἶνον ὕδατι·
οἱ ἄρχοντές σου ἀπειθοῦσιν κοινωνοὶ κλεπτῶν, ἀγαπῶντες δῶρα, διώκοντες ἀνταπόδομα, ὀρφανοῖς οὗ κρίνοντες καὶ κρίσιν χήρας οὔ προσέχοντες.
διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει ὁ δεσπότης Κύριος σαβαὼθ Οὐαὶ οἱ ἰσχύοντες Ἰερουσαλήμ·
οὗ παύσεται γάρ μου ὁ θυμὸς ἐν τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις, καὶ κρίσιν ἐκ τῶν ἐχθρῶν μου ποιήσω.
καὶ ἐπάξω τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ σὲ καὶ πυρώσω σε εἷς καθαρόν, τοὺς δὲ ἀπειθοῦντας ἀπολέσω, καὶ ἀφελῶ πάντας ἀνόμους ἀπὸ σοῦ·
καὶ πάντας ὑπερηφάνους ταπεινώσω.
] καὶ ἐπιστήσω τοὺς κριτάς σου ὡς τὸ πρότερον, καὶ τοὺς συμβούλους σου ὡς τὸ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς·
καὶ μετὰ, ταῦτα κληθήσῃ Πόλις δικαιοσύνης, μητρόπολις πιστὴ Σιών.
μετὰ γὰρ κρίματος σωθήσεται ἡ αἰχμαλωσία αὐτῆς καὶ μετὰ ἐλεημοσύνης.
καὶ συντριβήσονται οἱ ἄνομοι καὶ οἳ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἅμα, καὶ οἱ ἐγκαταλιπόντες τὸν κύριον συντελεσθήσονται·
διότι καταισχυνθήσονται ἐπὶ τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν ἃ αὐτοὶ ἠβούλοντο, καὶ ἐπαισχυνθήσονται ἐπὶ τοῖς κήποις αὐτῶν ὃ ἐπεθύμησαν.
ἔσονται γὰρ ὡς τερέβινθος ἀποβεβληκυῖα τὸ.
φύλλα, καὶ ὡς παράδεισος ὕδωρ μὴ ἔχων·
καὶ ἔσται ἦ ἰσχὺς αὐτῶν ὡς καλάμη στιππύου, καὶ αἱ ἐργασίαι αὑτῶν ὡς σπινθῆρες πυρός, καὶ κατακαυθήσονται οἱ ἄνομοι καὶ οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἅμα, καὶ οὔκ ἔσται ὅ σβέσων.
Ὁ λόγος ὃ γενόμενος παρὰ Κυρίου πρὸς Ἠσαίαν υἱὸν Ἀμὼς περὶ τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ περὶ Ἰερουσαλήμ.
Ὅτι ἔσται ἔν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις ἐμφανὲς τὸ ὅρος τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ ὅ οἶκος τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπ’ ἄκρων τῶν ὀρέων, καὶ ὑψωθήσεται ὑπεράνω τῶν βουνῶν, καὶ ἥξουσιν ἐπ’ αὐτὸ πάντα τὸ, ἔθνη.
καὶ πορεύσονται ἔθνη πολλὰ καὶ ἐροῦσιν Δεῦτε ἀναβῶμεν εἷς τὸ ὅρος τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ εἷς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ θεοῦ Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἀναγγελεῖ ἡμῖν τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πορευσόμεθα ἐν αὐτῇ.
ἐκ γὰρ Σειὼν ἐξελεύσεται νόμος, καὶ λόγος Κυρίου ἐξ Ἰερουσαλήμ·
καὶ κρινεῖ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἐλέγξει λαὸν πολύν·
καὶ συγκόψουσιν τὰς μαχαίρας αὐτῶν εἷς ἄροτρα καὶ τὰς ζιβύνας αὐτῶν εἷς δρέπανα, καὶ οὔ λήμψεται ἔτι ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος μάχαιραν, καὶ οὔ μὴ μάθωσιν ἔτι πολεμεῖν.
Καὶ νῦν, ὃ οἶκος τοῦ Ἰακώβ, δεῦτε πορευθῶμεν τῷ φωτὶ Κυρίου.
καὶ ἀνῆκεν γὰρ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ·
ὅτι ἐνεπλήσθη ὡς τὸ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς ἡ χώρα αὐτῶν κληδονισμῶν, ὡς ἡ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ τέκνα πολλὰ ἀλλόφυλα ἐγενήθη αὐτοῖς.
ἐνεπελήσθη γὰρ ἦ χώρα αὐτῶν ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμὸς τῶν θησαυρῶν αὐτῶν·
καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ γῆ αὐτῶν ἵππων, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμὸς τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτῶν·
καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ γῆ βδελυγμάτων τῶν ἔργων τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκύνησαν οἷς ἐποίησαν οἶ δάκτυλοι αὑτῶν·
καὶ ἔκυψεν ἅνθρωπος καὶ ἐταπεινώθη ἀνήρ, καὶ οὗ μὴ ἀνήσω αὐτούς.
καὶ νῦν εἰσέλθατε εἷς τὰς πέτρας καὶ κρύπτεσθε εἷς τὴν γῆν ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ φόβου Κυρίου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης τῆς ἰσχύος οῦ, ὅταν ἀναστῇ θραῦσαι τὴν γῆν.
οἱ γὰρ ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυρίου ὑψηλοί, ὃ δὲ ἅνθρωπος ταπεινός·
καὶ ταπεινωθήσεται τὸ ὕψος τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ὑψωθήσεται Κύριος μόνος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ.
ἡμέρα γὰρ Κυρίου σαβαὼθ ἐπὶ πάντα ὑβριστὴν καὶ ὑπερήφανον καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα ὑψηλὸν καὶ μετέωρον, καὶ ταπεινωθήσονται, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν κέδρον τοῦ Λιβάνου τῶν ὑψηλῶν καὶ μετεώρων, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν δένδρον βαλάνου Βασάν, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν ὅρος, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα βουνὸν ὑψηλόν, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα πύργον ὑψηλόν, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν τεῖχος ὑψηλόν, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν πλοῖον θαλάσσης, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν θέαν πλοίων κάλλους·
καὶ ταπεινωθήσεται πᾶς ἅνθρωπος, καὶ πεσεῖται ὕψος ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ὑψωθήσεται Κύριος μόνος ἐν τῇ ἐκείνῃ.
καὶ τὸ, χειροποίητα πάντα κατακρύψουσιν, εἰσενέγκαντες εἷς τὸ.
σπήλαια καὶ εἷς τὰς σχισμὸς τῶν πετρῶν καὶ εἷς τὰς τρώγλας τῆς γῆς, ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ φόβου Κυρίου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ, ὅταν ἀναστῇ θραῦσαι τὴν γῆν.
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκβαλεῖ ἅνθριιηνος τὰ βδελύγματα αὑτοῦ τὸ.
ἀργυρᾶ καὶ τὰ χρυσᾶ, οἳ ἐποίησεν προστοῦ εἰσελθεῖν εἷς τὰς κυνεῖν, τοῖς ματαίοις καὶ ταῖς νυκτερίσιν, τρώγλας τῆς στερεᾶς πέτρας καὶ εἰς τὰς σχισμὰς τῶν πετρῶν, ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ φόβου Κυρίου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης τῆς ἰσχύος αὑτοῦ, ὅταν ἀναστῇ θραῦσαι τὴν γῆν.
Ἰδοὺ δὴ ὁ δεσπότης κύριος σαβαὼθ ἀφελεῖ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ ἀπὸ Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἰσχύοντα καὶ ἰσχύουσαν, ἰσχὺν ἄρτου καὶ ἰσχὺν ὕδατος, γίγαντα καὶ ἰσχύοντα καὶ ἄνθρωπον πολεμιστὴν καὶ δικαστὴν καὶ προφήτην καὶ στοχαστὴν καὶ πρεσβύτερον καὶ πεντηκόνταρχον καὶ θαυμαστὸν σύμβουλον καὶ σοφὸν ἀρχιτέκτονα καὶ συνετὸν ἀκροατήν·
καὶ ἐπιστήσω νεανίσκους ἄρχοντας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐμπαῖκται κυριεύσουσιν αὐτῶν.
καὶ συμπεσεῖται ὁ λαός, ἄνθρωπος πρὸς ἄνθρωπον καὶ ἄνθρωπος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ·
προσκόψει τὸ παιδίον πρὸς τὸν πρεσβύτην, ὁ ἄτιμος πρὸς τὸν ἔντιμον.
ὅτι ἐπιλήμψεται ἄνθρωπος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ ἢ τοῦ οἰκείου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ λέγων Ἱμάτιον ἔχεις, ἀρχηγὸς ἡμῶν γενοῦ, καὶ τὸ βρῶμα τὸ ἐμὸν ὑπὸ σὲ ἔστω.
καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ἐρεῖ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ Οὐκ ἔσομαί σου ἀρχηγός·
οὐ γὰρ ἔστιν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου ἄρτος οὐδὲ ἱμάτιον·
οὐκ ἔσομαι ἀρχηγὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου.
ὅτι ἀνεῖται Ἰερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἡ Ἰουδαία συμπέπτωκεν, καὶ αἱ γλῶσσαι αὐτῶν μετὰ ἀνομίας, τὰ πρὸς κύριον ἀπειθοῦντες·
διότι νῦν ἐταπεινώθη ἡ δόξα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ αἰσχύνη τοῦ προσώπου αὐτῶν ἀντέστη αὐτοῖς·
τὴν δὲ ἁμαρτίαν αὐτῶν ὡς Σοδομων ἀνήγγειλαν καὶ ἐνεφάνισαν.
οὐαὶ τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν, διότι βεβούλευνται βουλὴν πονηρὰν καθ᾽ ἑαυτῶν, εἴπαντες Δήσωμεν τὸν δίκαιον, ὅτι δύσχρηστος ἡμῖν ἐστιν·
τοίνυν τὰ γενήματα τῶν ἔργων αὐτῶν φάγονται.
οὐαὶ τῷ ἀνόμῳ·
πονηρὰ κατὰ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ συμβήσεται αὐτῷ.
λαός μου, οἱ πράκτορες ὑμῶν καλαμῶνται ὑμᾶς, καὶ οἱ ἀπαιτοῦντες κυριεύουσιν ὑμῶν·
λαός μου, οἱ μακαρίζοντες ὑμᾶς πλανῶσιν ὑμᾶς καὶ τὸν τρίβον τῶν ποδῶν ὑμῶν ταράσσουσιν.
ἀλλὰ νῦν καταστήσεται εἰς κρίσιν κύριος καὶ στήσει εἰς κρίσιν τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ·
αὐτὸς κύριος εἰς κρίσιν ἥξει μετὰ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ μετὰ τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτοῦ.
ὑμεῖς δὲ τί ἐνεπυρίσατε τὸν ἀμπελῶνά μου καὶ ἡ ἁρπαγὴ τοῦ πτωχοῦ ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις ὑμῶν;
τί ὑμεῖς ἀδικεῖτε τὸν λαόν μου καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον τῶν πτωχῶν καταισχύνετε;
άδε λέγει Κύριος Ἀνθ’ ὧν ὑψώθησαν αἱ θυγατέρες Σιών, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὑψηλῷ τραχήλῳ καὶ νεύμασιν ὀφθαλμῶν, καὶ τῇ πορείᾳ τῶν ποδῶν ἅμα σύρουσαι τοὺς χιτῶνας καὶ τοῖς ποσὶν ἅμα καὶ ταπεινώσει ὁ θεὸς ἀρχούσας θυγατέρας Σιών.
παίζουσαι, καὶ Κύριος ἀποκαλύψει τό σχῆμα αύτῶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ·
καὶ ἀφελεῖ Κύριος τὴν δόξαν τοῦ ἱματισμοῦ αύτῶν, καὶ τοὺς κόσμους αύτῶν καὶ τὰ ἐμπλόκια καὶ τοὺς κοσύμβους καὶ τοὺς μηνίσκους, καὶ τὸ κάθεμα καὶ τὸν κόσμον τοῦ προσώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν σύνθεσιν τοῦ κόσμου τῆς δόξης αύτῶν, καὶ τοὺς χλιδῶνας καὶ τὰ ψέλια καὶ τὸ ἐμπλόκιον καὶ τὰ περιδέξια καὶ τοὺς δακτυλίους καὶ τὰ ἐνώτια, καὶ τὰ περιπόρφυρα καὶ τὰ μεσοπόρφυρα, καὶ τὸ, ἐπιβλήματα τὸ, κατὰ τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ τὰ διαφανῆ Λακωνικά, καὶ τὰ βύσσινα καὶ τὰ ὑακίνθινα καὶ τὰ κόκκινα, καὶ τὴν βύσσον, σὺν χρυσίῳ καὶ ὑακίνθῳ συνκαθυφασμένα, καὶ θέριστρα κατάκλιτα.
καὶ ἔσται ἀντὶ ὀσμῆς ἡδείας κονιορτός, καὶ ἀντὶ ζώνης σχοινίῳ ζώσῃ, καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ κόσμου τῆς κεφαλῆς τοῦ χρυσίου φαλάκρωμα ἔξεις διὰ τὰ ἔργα σου, καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ χιτῶνος τοῦ μεσοπορφύρου περιζώσῃ σάκκον.
καὶ ὃ υἱός σου ὁ κάλλιστος ὃν ἀγαπᾷς μαχαίρᾳ πεσεῖται, καὶ οἷ ἰσχύοντες ὑμῶν μαχαίρᾳ πεσοῦνται καὶ ταπεινωθήσονται·
καὶ πενθήσουσιν αἱ θῆκαι τοῦ κόσμου ὑμῶν, καὶ καταλειφθήσῃ μόνη καὶ εἷς τὴν γῆν ἐδαφισθήσῃ.
καὶ ἐπιλήμψονται ἑπτὰ γυναῖκες ἀνθρώπου ἑνὸς λέγουσαι Τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν φαγόμεθα, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια ἡμῶν περιβαλούμεθα·
πλὴν τὸ ὄνομα τὸ σὸν κεκλήσθω ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς, ἄφελε τὸν ὀνειδισμὸν ἡμῶν.
Τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ λάμψει ὅ θεὸς ἐν βουλῇ μετὰ δόξης ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, τοῦ ὑψῶσαι καὶ δοξάσαι τὸ καταλειφθὲν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ καὶ ἔσται τὸ ὑπολειφθὲν ἐν Σιὼν καὶ τὸ καταλειφθὲν ἔν Ἰερουσαλήμ, ἅγιοι κληθήσονται πάντες οἶ γραφέντες εἷς ζωὴν ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ.
ὅτι ἐκπλυνεῖ Κύριος τὸν ῥύπον τῶν υἱῶν καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων Σιών, καὶ τὸ αἷμα ἐκκαθαριεῖ ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν έν πνεύματι κρίσεως.
καὶ ἥξει, καὶ ἔσται πᾶς τόπος τοῦ ὅρους Σιὼν καὶ πάντα τὸ.
περικύκλῳ αὐτῆς σκιάσει νεφέλη ἡμέρας, καὶ ὡς καπνοῦ καὶ ὡς φωτὸς πυρὸς καιομένου νυκτός·
πάσῃ τῇ δόξῃ Κυρίου σκεπασθήσεται·
καὶ ἔσται εἷς σκιὰν ἀπὸ καύματος, καὶ ἐν σκέπῃ καὶ ἐν ἀποκρύφῳ σκληρότητος καὶ ὑετοῦ.
Ἅσω δὴ τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ ᾆσμα τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ τῷ ἀμπελῶνί μου.
ἀμπελὼν ἐγενήθη τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ ἐν κέρατι ἐν τόπῳ πίονι.
καὶ φραγμὸν περιέθηκα καὶ ἐχαράκωσα, καὶ ἐφύτευσα ἄμπελον σωρήχ, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησα πύργον ἐν μέσῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ προλήνιον ὥρυξα ἐν αὑτῷ·
καὶ ἔμεινα τοῦ ποιῆσαι σταφυλήν, ἐποίησεν δὲ ἀκάνθας.
καὶ νῦν, ἅνθρωπος τοῦ Ἰούδα καὶ οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ, τί ποιήσω ἔτι κρίνατε ἐν ἐμοὶ καὶ ἀνὰ, μέσον τοῦ ἀμπελῶνός μου.
τῷ ἀμπελῶνί μου, καὶ οὔκ ἐποίησα αὐτῷ;
διότι ἔμεινα τοῦ ποιῆσαι σταφυλήν, ἐποίησεν δὲ ἀκάνθας.
νῦν δὲ ἀναγγελῶ ὑμῖν τί ποιήσω τῷ ἀμπελῶνί μου.
ἀφελῶ τὸν φραγμὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔσται εἷς διαρπαγήν, καὶ καθελῶ τὸν τοῖχον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔσται εἷς x003E;
καὶ ἀνήσω τὸν ἀμπελῶνά μου, καὶ οὔ μὴ τμηθῇ οὐδὲ μὴ σκαφῇ, καὶ ἀναβήσεται εἷς αὐτὸν ὡς εἷς χέρσον ἄκανθα.
καὶ ταῖς νεφέλαις ἐντελοῦμαι τοῦ μὴ βρέξαι εἷς αὐτὸν ὑετόν.
ὁ γὰρ ἀμπελὼν Κυρίου σαβαὼθ οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ ἐστιν, καὶ ἅνθρωπος τοῦ Ἰούδα νεόφυτον ἠγαπημένον·
ἔμεινα τοῦ ποιῆσαι κρίσιν, ἐποίησεν δὲ ἀνομίαν, καὶ οὔ δικαιοσύνην ἀλλὰ κραυγήν.
Οὐαὶ οἱ συνάπτοντες οἰκίαν πρὸς οἰκίαν, καὶ ἀγρὸν πρὸς ἀγρὸν ἐγγίζοντες, ἵνα τοῦ πλησίον ἀφέλωνταί τι·
μὴ οἰκήσετε μόνοι ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς;
ἠκούσθη γὰρ εἷς τὰ ὦτα Κυρίου σαβαὼθ ταῦτα·
ἐὰν γὰρ γένωνται οἰκίαι πολλαί, εἷς ἔρημον ἔσονται·
μεγάλαι καὶ καλαί, καὶ οὐκ ἔσονται οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες.
οὑ γὰρ ἐργῶνται δέκα ζεύγη βοῶν, ποιήσει κεράμιον ἔν, καὶ ὃ σπείρων ἀρτάβας ἒξ ποιήσει μέτρα τρία.
Οὐαὶ οἱ ἐγειρόμενοι τὸ πρωὶ καὶ τὸ σίκερα διώκοντες, οἷ μένοντες τὸ ὀψέ·
ὁ γὰρ οἶνος αὐτοὺς συγκαύσει.
μετὰ γὰρ κιθάρας καὶ ψαλτηρίου καὶ τυμπάνων καὶ αὐλῶν τὸν οἶνον πίνουσιν, τὰ δὲ ἔργα Κυρίου οὐκ ἐμβλέπουσιν, καὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ οὗ κατανοοῦσιν.
τοίνυν αἰχμάλωτος ὃ λαός μου ἐγενήθη διὰ τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι αὐτοὺς τὸν κύριον, καὶ πλῆθος ἐγενήθη νεκρῶν διὰ λιμὸν καὶ δίψαν ὕδατος.
καὶ ἐπλάτυνεν ὃ ᾅδης τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ διήνοιξεν τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ τοῦ μὴ διαλιπεῖν, καὶ καταβήσονται οἱ ἔνδοξοι καὶ οἱ μεγάλοι καὶ οἱ πλούσιοι καὶ οἱ λοιμοὶ αὐτῆς.
καὶ καὶ ταπεινωθήσεται ἅνθρωπος, καὶ ἀτιμασθήσεται ἀνήρ, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ οἱ μετέωροι ταπεινωθήσονται·
καὶ ὑψωθήσεται Κύριοςσαβαὼθ ἐν κρίματι, καὶ ὃ θεὸς ὃ ἅγιος δοξασθήσεται ἐν καὶ βοσκηθήσονται οἱ διηρπασμένοι ὡς ταῦροι, καὶ δικαιοσύνῃ.
τὰς ἐρήμους τῶν ἀπειλημμένων ἄρνες φάγονται.
Οὐαὶ οἱ ἐπισπώμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὡς σχοινίῳ μακρῷ, καὶ ὡς ζυγοῦ ἱμάντι δαμάλεως τὰς ἀνομίας, οἱ λέγοντες Τὸ τάχος ἐγγισάτω ἅ ποιήσει, ἴνα ἴδωμεν, καὶ ἔλθοι ἡ βουλὴ τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰσραήλ, ἵνα γνῶμεν.
Οὐαὶ οἱ λέγοντες τὸ πονηρὸν καλὸν καὶ τὸ καλὸν πονηρόν, οἱ τιθέντες τὸ σκότος φῶς καὶ τὸ φῶς σκότος, οἱ τιθέντες τὸ πικρὸν γλυκὺ καὶ τὸ γλυκὺ πικρόν.
Οὐαὶ οἱ συνετοὶ ἐν ἑαυτοῖς καὶ ἐνώπιον ἑαυτῶν ἐπιστήμονες.
Οὐαὶ οἱ ἰσχύοντες ὑμῶν οἱ τὸν οἶνον πίνοντες καὶ οἱ δυνάσται οἱ κεραννύντες τὸ σίκερα, Οἱ δικαιοῦντες τὸν ἀσεβῆ ἕνεκεν δώρων καὶ τὸ δίκαιον τοῦ δικαίου αἴροντες.
διὰ τοῦτο ὃν τρόπον καυθήσεται καλάμη ὑπὸ ἄνθρακος πυρός, καὶ συγκαυθήσεται ὑπὸ φλογὸς ἀνειμένης, ἡ ῥίζα αὐτῶν ὡς χνοῦς ἔσται, καὶ τὸ ἄνθος αὐτῶν ὡς κονιορτὸς ἀναβήσεται·
οὐ γὰρ ἠθέλησαν τὸν νόμον Κυρίου σαβαώθ, ἀλλὰ τὸ λόγιον τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰσραὴλ παρώξυναν.
καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Κύριος σαβαὼθ εἷς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέβαλεν τὴν χεῖρα αὑτοῦ ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτούς·
καὶ παρωξύνθη τὸ, ὅρη, καὶ ἐγενήθη τὰ θνησιμαῖα αὐτῶν ὡς κοπρία ἐν μέσῳ ὁδοῦ.
ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις οὐκ ἀπεστράφη ὁ θυμός, ἀλλ’ ἔτι ἡ χεὶρ ὑψηλή.
τοιγαροῦν ἀρεῖ σύσσημον ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν τοῖς μακρὰν καὶ συριεῖ αὐτοῖς ἀπ’ ἄκρου τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἰδοὺ ταχὺ κούφως ἔρχονται.
οὐ πεινάσουσιν οὐδὲ κοπιάσουσιν οὐδὲ νυστάξουσιν οὐδε κοιμηθήσονται, οὐδ’ οὐ μὴ λύσουσιν τὰς ζώνας αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτῶν, οὐδὲ μὴ ῥαγῶσιν οἱ ἱμάντες τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτῶν·
ὧν τὸ, βέλη ὀξεῖά ἐστιν καὶ τὸ.
τόξα αὐτῶν ἐντεταμένα.
οἱ πόδες τῶν ἵππων αὐτῶν ὡς στερεὰ πέτρα·
ἐλογίσθησαν οἶ τροχοὶ τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτῶν ὡς καταιγίς.
ὁρμῶσιν ὡς λέοντες, καὶ παρεστήκασιν ὡς σκύμνος λέοντος·
καὶ ἐπιλήμψεται, καὶ βοήσεται ὡς θηρίον, καὶ ἐκβαλεῖ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὃ ῥυόμενος.
καὶ βοήσεται δι’ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ὡς φωνὴ θαλάσσης κυμαι- νούσης·
καὶ ἐμβλέψονται εἷς τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἰδοὺ σκότος σκληρὸν ἐν τῇ ἀπορίᾳ αὐτῶν.
Καὶ ἐγένετο τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ οὗ ἀπέθανεν Ὀζίας ὃ βασιλεὺς ἴδον τὸν κύριον καθήμενον ἐπὶ θρόνου ὑψηλοῦ καὶ ἐπηρμένου, καὶ πλήρης ὅ οἶκος τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ.
καὶ σεραφεὶν ἱστήκεισαν κύκλῳ αὑτοῦ, ἓξ πτέρυγες τῷ ἑνί, καὶ ἓξ πτέρυγες τῷ ἐνί·
καὶ ταῖς μὲν δυσὶν κατεκάλυπτον τὸ πρόσωπον, καὶ ταῖς δυσὶν κατεκάλυπτον τοὺς πόδας, καὶ ταῖς δυσὶν ἐπέταντο.
καὶ ἐκέκραγον ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον καὶ ἔλεγον Ἄγιος ἅγιος ἅγιος Κύριος σαβαώθ, πλήρης πᾶσα ἡ γῆ τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ.
καὶ ἐπήρθη τὸ ὑπέρθυρον ἀπὸ τῆς φωνῆς ἧς ἐκέκραγον, καὶ ὁ οἶκος ἐπλήσθη καπνοῦ.
καὶ εἶπαὮ τάλας ἐγώ, ὅτι κατανένυγμαι, ὅτι ἅνθρωπος ὢν καὶ ἀκάθαρτα χείλη ἔχων ἐν μέσῳ λαοῦ ἀκάθαρτα χείλη ἔχοντος ἐγὼ οἰκῶ, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Κύριον σαβαὼθ εἶδον τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς μου.
καὶ καὶ ἀπεστάλη πρὸς μὲ ἓν τῶν σεραφείμ, καὶ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ εἶχεν ἄνθρακα πυρὸς ὃν τῇ λαβίδι ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ ἥψατο τοῦ στόματός μου καὶ εἶπεν Ἰδοὺ ἥψατο τοῦτο τῶν χειλέων σου, καὶ ἀφελεῖ τὰς ἀνομίας σου, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου περικαθαριεῖ.
καὶ ἥκουσα τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου λέγοντος Τίνα ἀποστείλω, καὶ τίς πορεύσεται πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον;
καὶ εἶπα Ἰδού εἰμι ἐγώ·
ἀπόστειλόν με.
καὶ εἶπεν Πορεύθητι καὶ εἰπὸν τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ Ἀκοῇ ἀκούσετε καὶ οὐ μὴ συνῆτε, καὶ βλέποντες βλέψετε καὶ οὐ μὴ ἴδητε.
ἐπαχύνθη γὰρ ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν αὐτῶν βαρέως ἥκουσαν, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάμμυσαν, μή ποτε ἴδωσιν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν ἀκούσωσιν, καὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ συνῶσιν καὶ ἐπιστρέψωσιν, καὶ ἰάσομαι αὐτούς.
καὶ εἶπα Ἕως πότε, Κύριε;
καὶ εἶπεν Ἕως ἂν ἐρημωθῶσιν πόλεις παρὰ τὸ μὴ κατοικεῖσθαι, καὶ οἶκοι παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἀνθρώπους, καὶ ἡ γῆ καταλειφθήσεται ἔρημος.
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα μακρυνεῖ ὁ θεὸς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, καὶ οἱ καταλειφθέντες πληθυνθήσονται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔτι ἐπ’ αὐτῆς ἐστιν τὸ ἐπιδέκατον, καὶ πάλιν ἔσται εἰς προνομήν, ὡς τερέβινθος καὶ ὡς βάλανος ὅταν ἐκσπασθῇ ἀπὸ τῆς θήκης αὐτῆς.
Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέρως Ἀχάζ τοῦ Ἰωαθὰμ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ὀζίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα ἀνέβη ῾Ραασσὼν βασιλεὺς Ἀρὰμ καὶ Φάκεε υἱὸς ῾Ρομελίου βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Ἰερουσαλὴμ πολεμῆσαι αὐτήν, καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν πολιορκῆσαι αὐτήν.
καὶ ἀνηγγέλη εἰς τὸν οἶκον Δαυεὶδ λέγοντες Συνεφώνησεν Ἀρὰμ πρὸς τὸν Ἐφράιμ·
καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὅταν ὃν τρόπον ἐν δρυμῷ ξύλον ὑπὸ πνεύματος σαλευθῇ.
Καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος πρὸς Ἠσαίαν Ἔξελθε εἰς συνάντησιν Ἀχὰζ σὺ καὶ ὁ καταλειφθεὶς Ἰασσοὺβ ὁ <υἱός> σου πρὸς τὴν κολυμβήθραν τῆς ἄνω ὁδοῦ τοῦ ἀγροῦ τοῦ γναφέως.
καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτῷ Φύλαξαι τοῦ ἡσυχάσαι καὶ μὴ φοβοῦ, μηδὲ ἡ ψυχή σου ἀσθενείτω ἀπὸ τῶν δύο ξύλων τῶν δαλῶν τῶν καπνιζομένων τούτων·
ὅταν γὰρ ὀργὴ τοῦ θυμοῦ μου γένηται, πάλιν ἰάσομαι.
καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀρὰμ καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ῾Ρομελίου, ὅτι ἐβουλεύσαντο βουλὴν πονηρὰν περὶ σοῦ, λέγοντες Ἀναβησόμεθα εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν, καὶ συλλαλήσαντες αὐτοῖς ἀποστρέψωμεν αὐτοὺς πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ βασιλεύσομεν αὐτοῖς τὸν υἱὸν Ταβεήλ·
τάδε λέγει Κύριος σαβαώθ Οὐ μὴ ἐμμείνῃ ἡ βουλὴ αὕτη οὐδὲ ἔσται.
ἀλλ᾿ ἡ κεφαλὴ Ἀρὰμ Δαμασκός, καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ Δαμασκοῦ ῾Ρασείν·
ἀλλ᾿ ἔτι ἐξήκοντα καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἐκλείψει ἡ βασιλεία Ἐφράιμ ἀπὸ λαοῦ.
καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ Ἐφράιμ Σομορών, καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ Σομορὼν υἱὸς τοῦ ῾Ρομελίου·
καὶ ἐὰν μὴ πιστεύσητε, οὐδὲ μὴ συνῆτε.
Καὶ προσέθετο θετο Κύριος λαλῆσαι τῷ Ἀχὰζ λέγων αἴτησαι σεαυτῷ σημεῖον παρὰ Κυρίου θεοῦ σου εἰς βάθος ἢ εἰς ὕψος.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἀχάζ Οὐ μὴ αἰτήσω, οὐδ᾿ οὐ μὴ πειράσω Κύρων.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἀκούσατε δή, οἷκος Δαυείδ.
μὴ μικρὸν ὑμῖν ἀγῶνα παρέχειν ἀνθρώποις, καὶ πῶς Κυρίῳ παρέχετε ἀγῶνα;
διὰ τοῦτο δώσει Κύριος αὐτὸς ὑμῖν σημεῖον·
ἰδοὺ ἡ παρθένος ἐν γαστρὶ ἔξει καὶ τέξεται υἱόν, καὶ καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἐμμανουήλ·
βούτυρον βούτυρον καὶ μέλι φάγεται·
πρὶν ἤ γνῶναι αὐτὸν προελέσθαι πονηρά, ἐκλέξεται τὸ ἀγαθόν·
διότι πρὶν ἢ γνῶναι τὸν παιδίον ἀγαθὸν ἡ κακόν, ἀπειθεῖ πονηρίᾳ.
τοῦ ἐκλέξασθαι τὸ ἀγαθόν, καὶ καταλειφθήσεται ἡ γῆ ἥν σὺ φοβῇ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν.
ἀλλὰ ἐπάξει ὁ θεὸς ἐπὶ σὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν σου καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός σου ἡμέρας αἵ οὔπω ἦκασιν ἀφ’ ἧς ἡμέρας ἀφεῖλεν Ἐφράιμ ἀπὸ Ἰούδα, τὸν βασιλέα τῶν Ἀσσυρίων.
Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ συριεῖ Κύριος μυίαις, ὃ κυριεύει μέρους ποταμοῦ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ τῇ μελίσσῃ ἦ ἐστιν ἐν χώρᾳ Ἀσσυρίων·
καὶ ἐλεύσονται πάντες καὶ ἀναπαύσονται ἐν ταῖς φάραγξιν τῆς χώρας καὶ ἐν ταῖς τρώγλαις τῶν πετρῶν καὶ εἷς τὸ.
σπήλαια καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ῥαγάδα καὶ ἐν παντὶ ξύλῳ.
ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ξυρήσει Κύριος τῷ ξυρῷ τῷ μεγάλῳ καὶ μεμεθυσμένῳ ὅ ἐστιν πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, τὴν κεφαλήν, καὶ τὰς τρίχας τῶν ποδῶν, καὶ τὸν πώγωνα ἀφελεῖ.
καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ.
ἐκείνῃ θρέψει ἅνθρωπος δάμαλιν βοῶν καὶ δύο πρόβατα·
καὶ ἔσται ἀπὸ τοῦ πλεῖστον ποιεῖν γάλα, βούτυρον καὶ μέλι φάγεται πᾶς ὃ καταλειφθεὶς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ πᾶς τόπος οὗ ἐὰν ὦσιν χίλιαι ἄμπελοι χιλίων σίκλων, εἷς χέρσον ἔσονται καὶ ἄκανθαν·
μετὰ βέλους καὶ τοξεύματος εἰσελεύσονται ἐκεῖ, ὅτι χέρσος καὶ ἄκανθα ἔσται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ·
καὶ πᾶν ὄρος ἀροτριώμενον ἀροτρια θήσεται·
καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐπέλθῃ ἐκεῖ φόβος·
ἔσται γὰρ ἀπὸ τῆς χέρσου καὶ ἀκάνθης εἷς βόσκημα προβάτου καὶ εἷς καταπάτημα βοός.
Καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος πρὸς μέ Λάβε σεαυτῷ τόμον χάρτου καινοῦ μεγάλου, καὶ γράψον εἷς αὐτὸν γραφίδι ἀνθρώπου τοῦ ὀξέως προνομὴν ποιῆσαι σκύλων·
πάρεστιν γάρ·
καὶ μάρτυράς μοι ποίησον πιστοὺς ἀνθρώπους, τὸν Οὐρίαν καὶ τὸν Ζαχαρίαν υἱὸν Βαραχίου.
καὶ προσῆλθεν πρὸς τὴν προφῆτιν, καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβεν καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱόν.
καὶ εἶπεν Κύριός μοι Κάλεσον τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ταχέως σκύλευσον, ὀξέως προνόμευσον.
διότι πρὶν ἢ γνῶναι τὸ παιδίον καλεῖν πατέρα ἢ μητέρα, λήμψεται δύναμιν Δαμασκοῦ καὶ τὰ σκῦλα Σαμαρείας ἔναντι βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων.
Καὶ προσέθετο Κύριος λαλῆσαί μοι ἔτι Διὰ τὸ μὴ βούλεσθαι τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ Σιλωὰμ τὸ πορευόμενον ἡσυχῇ, ἀλλὰ.
βούλεσθαι ἔχειν τὸν ῾Ραασσὼν καὶ τὸν υἱὸν ῾Ρομελίου βασιλέα ἐφ’ ὑμῶν, διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἀνάγει Κύριος ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τὸ ἰσχυρὸν καὶ τὸ πολύ, τὸν βασιλέα τῶν Ἀσσυρίων καὶ τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἀναβήσεται ἐπὶ πᾶσαν φάραγγα ὑμῶν, καὶ περιπατήσει ἐπὶ πᾶν τεῖχος ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀφελεῖ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰουδαίας ἄνθρωπον ὃς δυνήσεται κεφαλὴν ἆραι εἰ δυνατὸν συντελέσαι τι·
καὶ ἔσται ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὑτοῦ τὰ πλάτη τῆς χώρας σου.
μεθ’ ἡμῶν ὃ θεός.
γνῶτε ἔθνη καὶ ἡττᾶσθε, ἐπακούσετε ἔως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς, ἰσχυκότες ἡττᾶσθε·
ἐὰν γὰρ πάλιν ἰσχύσητε, πάλιν ἡττηθήσεσθε.
καὶ ἥν ἂν βουλεύσησθε βουλὴν διασκεδάσει Κύριος, καὶ τὸν λόγον ὃν ἐὰν λαλήσητε οὐ μὴ ἐμμείνῃ ὑμῖν, ὅτι μεθ’ ἡμῶν Κύριος ὁ θεός.
οὕτω λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεός Τῇ ἰσχυρᾷ χειρὶ ἀπειθοῦσιν τῇ πορείᾳ, τῆς ὁδοῦ τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, λέγοντες Μή ποτε εἴπητε σκληρόν·
πᾶν γὰρ ὃ ἂν εἴπῃ ὁ λαὸς οὗτος σκληρόν ἐστιν·
τὸν δὲ φόβον αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ φοβηθῆτε οὐδ᾿ οὐ μὴ ταραχθῆτε·
Κύριον αὐτὸν ἁγιάσατε, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται σου φόβος.
καὶ ἐὰν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ πεποιθὼς ᾖς, ἔσται σοι εἰς ἁγίασμα, καὶ οὐχ ὡς λίθου προσκόμματι συναντήσεσθε αὐτῷ, οὐδὲ ὡς πέτρας πτώματι.
ὁ δὲ οἶκος Ἰακὼβ ἐν παγίδι, καὶ ἐν κοιλάσματι ἐγκαθήμενοι ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ·
διὸ, τοῦτο ἀδυνατήσουσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς πολλοί, καὶ πεσοῦνται καὶ συντριβήσονται, καὶ ἐγγιοῦσιν καὶ ἁλώσονται ἅνθρωποι ἐν ἀσφαλείᾳ ὄντες.
Τότε φανεροὶ ἔσονται οἱ σφραγιζόμενοι τὸν νόμον τοῦ μαθεῖν.
καὶ ἐρεῖ Μενῶ τὸν θεὸν τὸν ἀποστρέψαντα τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Ἰακώβ, καὶ πεποιθὼς ἔσομαι ἐπ’ αὐτῷ.
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ καὶ τὸ, παιδία ἅ μοι ἔδωκεν ὃ θεός.
καὶ ἔσται εἷς σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ παρὰ Κυρίου σαβαώθ, ὃς κατοικεῖ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σιών.
καὶ ἐὰν εἴπωσιν πρὸς ὑμᾶς Ζητήσατε τοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς φωνοῦντας καὶ τοὺς ἐγγαστριμύθους, τοὺς κενολογοῦντας οἳ ἀπὸ τῆς κοιλίας φωνοῦσιν, οὐκ ἔθνος πρὸς θεὸν αὐτοῦ;
τί ἐκζητῶσιν περὶ τῶν ζώντων τοὺς νεκρούς;
νόμον γὰρ εἷς βοήθειαν ἔδωκεν, ἵνα εἴπωσιν οὐχ ὡς τὸ τοῦτο, περὶ οὗ οὐκ ἔστιν δῶρα δοῦναι περὶ αὐτοῦ.
καὶ ἥξει ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς σκληρὰ λιμός, καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἂν πεινάσητε, λυπηθήσεσθε καὶ κακῶς ἐρεῖτε τὸν ἄρχοντα καὶ τὰ πάτρια, καὶ ἀναβλέψονται εἷς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἄνω, καὶ εἰς τὴν γῆν κάτω ἐμβλέψονται·
καὶ ἰδοὺ θλῖψις καὶ στενοχωρία καὶ σκότος, ἀπορία στενὴ καὶ σκότος ὥστε μὴ βλέπειν, καὶ οὐκ ἀπορηθήσεται ὃ ἐν στενοχωρίᾳ ἔως καιροῦ.
Τοῦτο πρῶτον πίε, ταχὺ ποίει, χώρα Ζαβουλών, ἡ γῆ Νεφθαλείμ, ὁδὸν θαλάσσης, καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ οἱ τὴν παράλων κατοικοῦντες καὶ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, Γαλιλαία τῶν ἐθνῶν, τὰ μέρη τῆς Ἰουδαίας.
ὁ λαὸς ὃ καθήμενος ἐν σκότει, ἴδετε φῶς μέγα·
οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν χώρᾳ, καὶ σκιᾷ θανάτου, φῶς λάμψει ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς.
τὸ πλεῖστον τοῦ λαοῦ ὃ κατήγαγες ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ σου, καὶ εὐφραν- θήσονται ἐνώπιόν σου ὡς οἱ εὐφραινόμενοι ἐν ἀμήτῳ, καὶ ὃν τρόπον εὐφραίνονται οἱ διαιρούμενοι σκῦλα.
διότι ἀφαιρεθήσεται ὃ ζυγὸς ὃ ἐπ’ αὐτῶν κείμενος, καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος ἡ ἐπὶ τοῦ τραχήλου αὐτῶν·
τὴν γὰρ ῥάβδον τῶν ἀπαιτούντων διεσκέδασεν Κύριος, ὡς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἐπὶ Μαδιάμ.
ὅτι πᾶσαν στολὴν ἐπισυνηγμένην δόλῳ καὶ ἱμάτιον μετὰ καταλλαγῆς ἀποτίσουσιν, καὶ θελήσουσιν εἰ ἐγενήθησαν πυρίκαυστοι, ὅτι παιδίον ἐγενήθη ἡμῖν, υἱὸς καὶ ἐδόθη ἡμῖν, οὗ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἐγενήθη ἐπὶ τοῦ ὤμου αὐτοῦ, καὶ καλέσει τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Μεγάλης βουλῆς ἅγγελος, θαυμαστὸς σύμβουλος, ἰσχυρός, ἐξουσιαστής, ἅρχων εἰρήνης, πατὴρ τοῦ μέλλοντος αἰῶνος·
ἐγὼ γὰρ ἄξω εἰρήνην ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας, εἰρήνην καὶ ὑγίαν αὐτῷ.
Μεγάλη ἡ ἀρχὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῆς εἰρήνης αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔστιν ὅριον, ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον Δαυεὶδ καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ, κατορθῶσαι αὐτὴν καὶ ἀντιλαβέσθαι αὐτῆς ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ἐν κρίματι, ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον·
ὃ ζῆλος Κυρίου σαβαὼθ ποιήσει ταῦτα.
Θάνατον ἀπέστειλεν Κύριος ἐπὶ Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ καὶ γνώσονται πᾶς, ὃ λαὸς τοῦ Ἐφράιμ, καὶ οἶ ἐγκαθήμενοι ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἐφ’ ὕβρει καὶ ὑψηλῇ καρδίᾳ, λέγοντες Πλίνθοι πεπτώκασιν, ἀλλὰ δεῦτε λαξεύσωμεν λίθους, καὶ ἐκκόψωμεν συκαμίνους καὶ κέδρους, καὶ οἰκοδομήσωμεν ἑαυτοῖς πύργον.
καὶ ῥάξει ὃ θεὸς τοὺς ἐπανιστανομένους ἐπ’ ὅρους Σιὼν ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτῶν διασκεδάσει, Συρίαν ἀφ’ ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν καὶ τοὺς Ἕλληνας ἀφ’ ἡλίου δυσμῶν, τοὺς κατεσθίοντας τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ὅλῳ τῷ στόματι.
ἐπὶ τούτοις πᾶσιν οὔκ ἀπεστράφη ὁ θυμός, ἀλλ’ ἔτι ἡ χεὶρ ὑψηλή.
καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὐκ ἀπεστράφη ἔως ἐπλήγη, καὶ τὸν κύριον οὔκ ἐξεζήτησαν.
Καὶ Καὶ ἀφεῖλεν Κύριος ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ κεφαλὴν καὶ οὐράν, μέγαν καὶ μικρὸν ἐν μία ἡμέρᾳ, πρεσβύτην καὶ τοὺς τὸ, πρόσωπα θαυμάζοντας, αὕτη ἡ ἀρχή, καὶ προφήτην διδάσκοντα ἄνομα, οὗτος ἡ οὐρά.
καὶ ἔσονται οἱ μακαρίζοντες τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον πλανῶντες, καὶ πλανῶσιν ὅπως καταπίωσιν αὐτούς.
διὰ τοῦτο ἐπὶ τοὺς νεανίσκους οὐκ εὐφρανθήσεται ὃ θεός, καὶ τοὺς ὀρφανοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς χήρας αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐλεήσει·
ὅτι πάντες ἄνομοι καὶ πονηροί, καὶ πᾶν στόμα λαλεῖ ἄδικα.
ἐπὶ πᾶσι τούτοις οὒκ ἀπεστράφη ὃ θυμός, ἀλλ’ ἔτι ἡ χεὶρ ὑψηλή.
Καὶ καυθήσεται ὡς πῦρ ἡ ἀνομία, καὶ ὡς ἄγρωστις ξηρὰ βρωθήσεται ὑπὸ πυρός·
καὶ καυθήσεται ἐν τοῖς δάσεσιν τοῦ δρυμοῦ, καὶ συγκαταφάγεται τὰ.
κύκλῳ τῶν βουνῶν πάντα·
διὰ θυμὸν ὀργῆς Κυρίου συγκαυθήσεται ἡ γῆ ὅλη, καὶ ἔσται ὃ λαὸς ὡς ὑπὸ πυρὸς κατακεκαυμένος.
ἅνθρωπος τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὑτοῦ οὐκ ἐλεήσει, ἀλλὰ ἐκκλινεῖ εἷς τὰ δεξιά, ὅτι πεινάσει, καὶ φάγεται ἐκ τῶν ἀριστερῶν, καὶ οὗ μὴ ἐμπλησθῇ, ἅνθρωπος ἔσθων τὰς σάρκας τοῦ βραχίονος[ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ] αὐτοῦ.
φάγεται γὰρ Μαννασσὴ τοῦ Ἐφράιμ, καὶ Ἐφράιμ τοῦ Μαννασσή.
ὅτι ἅμα πολιορκήσουσιν τὸν Ἰούδαν.
ἐπὶ τούτοις πᾶσιν οὐκ ἀπεστράφη ὁ θυμός, ἀλλ’ ἔτι ἡ χεὶρ Οὐαὶ τοῖς γράφουσιν πονηρίαν·
γράφοντες γὰρ πονηρίαν γράφουσιν, ἐκκλίνοντες κρίσιν πτωχῶν, καὶ ἁρπάζοντες κρίμα πενήτων τοῦ λαοῦ μου, ὥστε εἶναι αὐτοῖς χήραν εἷς ἁρπαγήν, καὶ ὀρφανὸν εἷς προνομήν.
καὶ τί ποιήσουσιν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐπισκοπῆς;
ἡ γὰρ θλίψις ὑμῖν πόρρωθεν ἥξει·
καὶ πρὸς τίνα καταφεύξεσθε τοῦ βοηθηθῆναι;
καὶ ποῦ καταλείψετε τὴν δόξαν ὑμῶν, τοῦ μὴ ἐμπεσεῖν εἰς ἐπαγωγήν;
καὶ ὑποκάτω ἀνῃρημένων πεσοῦνται.
ἐπὶ τούτοις πᾶσιν οὐκ ἀπεστράφη ὃ θυμός, ἀλλ’ ἔτι ἡ χεὶρ ὑψηλή.
Οὐαὶ Ἀσσυρίοις, ἡ ῥάβδος τοῦ θυμοῦ μου καὶ ὀργῆς ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν.
τὴν ὀργήν μου εἰς ἔθνος ἄνομον ἀποστέλλω, καὶ τῷ ἐμῷ λαῷ συντάξω τοῦ ποιῆσαι σκῦλα καὶ προνομήν, καὶ καταπατεῖν τὰς πόλεις καὶ θεῖναι αὐτὰς εἷς κονιορτόν.
αὐτὸς δὲ οὐχ οὕτως ἐνεθυμήθη, καὶ πῆ ψυχῇ οὔχ οὕτως λελόγισται·
ἀλλὰ ἀπαλλάξει ὃνοῦς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι ἔθνη οὐκ ὀλίγα.
καὶ ἐὰν εἴπωσιν αὐτῷ Σὺ μόνος εἶ ἅρχων, καὶ ἐρεῖ Οὐκ ἔλαβον τὴν χώραν τὴν ἐπάνω Βαβυλῶνος καὶ Χαλαννή, οὗ ὃ πύργος ᾠκοδομήθη;
καὶ ἔλαβον Ἀραβείαν καὶ Δαμασκὸν καὶ Σαμάρειαν·
ὃν τρόπον ταύτας ἔλαβον ἐν τῇ χειρί μου, καὶ πάσας τὰς χώρας λήμψομαι.
ὀλολύξατε, τὸ, γλυπτὰ ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ καὶ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ·
ὃν τρόπον γὰρ ἐποίησα Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ τοῖς χειροποιήτοις <αὐτῆς,> οὕτως ποιήσω καὶ Ἰερουσαλὴμ καὶ τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῆς.
Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν συντελέσῃ Κύριος πάντα ποιῶν έν τῷ ὄρει Σιὼν καὶ ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ, ἐπάξει ἐπὶ τὸν νοῦν τὸν μέγαν, τὸν ἄρχοντα τῶν Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ὕψος τῆς δόξης τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ.
εἶπεν γὰρ Τῇ ἰσχύι ποιήσω, καὶ <τῆ σοφίᾳ.
τῆς συνέσεως> ἀφελῶ ὅρια ἐθνῶν, καὶ τὴν προνομεύσω·
καὶ σείσω πόλεις κατοικουμένας, καὶ τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅλην καταλήμψομαι τῇ χειρί μου ὡς νοσσιάν, καὶ ὡς καταλελιμμένα ὠᾶ ἀρῶ·
καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς διαφεύξεταί με ἢ ἀντείπῃ μοι.
Μὴ δοξασθήσεται ἀξίνη ἄνευ τοῦ κόπτοντος έν αὐτῇ;
ἦ ὑψωθήσεται πρίων ἄνευ τοῦ ἕλκοντος αὐτόν;
ὡσαύτως ἐάν τις ἄρῃ ῥάβδον ἢ ξύλον, καὶ οὔχ οὕτως;
ἀλλὰ ἀποστελεῖ Κύριος σαβαὼθ εἷς τὴν σὴν τιμὴν ἀτιμίαν, καὶ εἷς τὴν σὴν δόξαν πῦρ καιόμενον καυθήσεται·
καὶ ἔσται τὸ φῶς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ὡς πῦρ, καὶ ἁγιάσει αὐτὸέν πυρὶ καιομένῳ, καὶ φάγεται ὡσεὶ χόρτον τὴν ὕλην.
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀποσβεσθήσεται τὸ, ὅρη καὶ οἶ δρυμοὶ καὶ οἶ βουνοί, καὶ καταφάγεται ἀπὸ ψυχῆς ἕως σαρκῶν·
καὶ ἔσται ὅ φεύγων ὡς ὅ φεύγων ἀπὸ φλογὸς καιομένης·
καὶ οἱ καταλειφθέντες ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἔσονται ἀριθμός, καὶ παιδίον γράψει αὐτούς.
Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ.
ἐκείνῃ οὐκέτι προστεθήσεται τὸ καταλειφθὲν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ σωθέντες τοῦ Ἰακὼβ οὐκέτι μὴ πεποιθότες ὦσιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀδικήσαντας αὐτούς, ἀλλ᾿ ἔσονται πεποιθότες ἐπὶ τὸν θεὸν τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ τῇ ἀληθείᾳ.
καὶ ἔσται τὸ καταλειφθὲν τοῦ Ἰακὼβ ἐπὶ θεὸν ἰσχύοντα.
καὶ ἐὰν γένηται ὁ λαός Ἰσραὴλ ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης, τὸ κατάλειμμα σωθήσεται·
λόγον γὰρ συντελῶν καὶ συντέμνων ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, ὅτι λόγον συντετμημένον ποιήσει ὁ θεός ἐν τῇ οἰκουμένῃ ὅλῃ.
Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεὸς σαβαώθ Μὴ φοβοῦ, ὁ λαός μου, οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Σιών, ἀπὸ Ἀσσυρίων, ὅτι ἐν ῥάβδῳ πατάξει σε·
πληγὴν γὰρ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ σέ, τοῦ ἰδεῖν ὁδὸν Αἰγύπτου.
ἔτι γὰρ μικρὸν καὶ παύσεται ἡ ὀργή, ὁ δὲ θυμός μου ἐπὶ τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν·
καὶ ἐπεγερεῖ ὁ θεὸς ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς κατὰ τὴν πληγὴν τὴν Μαδιὰμ ἐν τόπῳ θλίψεως, καὶ ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ τῇ ὁδῷ τῇ κατὰ θάλασσαν, εἰς τὴν ὁδόν τὴν κατ’ Αἴγυπτον.
καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀφαιρεθήσεται ὅ φόβος αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ὁ ζυγὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὤμου σου, καὶ καταφθαρήσεται ὁ ζυγὸς ἀπὸ τῶν ὤμων ὑμῶν.
ἥξει γὰρ εἰς τὴν πόλιν Ἀγγαί, καὶ παρελεύσεται εἰς Μαγεδδώ, καὶ ἐν Μαχμὰς θήσει τὰ, σκεύη αὐτοῦ·
καὶ παρελεύσεται φάραγγα καὶ ἥξει εἰς Ἀγγαί, φόβος λήμψεται ῾Ραμὰ πόλιν Σαούλ.
φεύξεται ἡ θυγάτηρ τηρ Γαλείμ, ἐπακούσεται ἐν Σά, ἐπακούσεται ἐν Ἀναθώθ·
ἐξέστη Μαδεβηνὰ καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γιββείρ.
παρακαλεῖτε σήμερον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ μεῖναι, τῇ χειρὶ παρακαλεῖτε τὸ ὄρος τὴν θυγατέρα Σιών, καὶ οἱ βουνοὶ οἱ ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ.
ἰδοὺ γὰρ ὁ δεσπότης Κύριος σαβαὼθ συνταράσσει τοὺς ἐνδόξους μετὰ ἰσχύος, καὶ οἱ ὑψηλοὶ τῇ ὕβρει συντριβήσονται, καὶ ταπεινωθήσονται οἱ ὑψηλοί, <καὶ πεσοῦνται ὑψηλοὶ> μαχαίρᾳ, ὁ δὲ Λίβανος σὺν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς πεσεῖται.
Καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ῥάβδος ἐκ τῆς ῥίζης Ἰεσσαί, καὶ ἄνθος ἐκ τῆς ῥίζης ἀναβήσεται.
καὶ ἀναπαύσεται ἐπ’ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα τοῦ θεοῦ, πνεῦμα σοφίας καὶ συνέσεως, πνεῦμα βουλῆς καὶ ἰσχύος, πνεῦμα γνώσεως καὶ εὐσεβείας·
ἐμπλήσει αὑτὸν πνεῦμα φόβου θεοῦ.
οὔ κατὰ τὴν δόξαν κρινεῖ, οὐδὲ κατὰ τὴν λαλιὰν ἐλέγξει, ἀλλὰ κρινεῖ ταπεινῷ κρίσιν, καὶ ἐλέγξει τοὺς ταπεινοὺς τῆς γῆς, καὶ πατάξει γῆν τῷ λόγῳ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν πνεύματι διὰ χειλέων ἀνελεῖ ἀσεβῆ·
καὶ ἔσται δικαιοσύνῃ ἐζωσμένος τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀληθείᾳ εἰλημμένος τὰς πλευράς.
καὶ συνβοσκηθήσεται λύκος μετὰ ἀρνός, καὶ πάρδαλις συναναπαύσεται ἐρίφῳ, καὶ μοσχάριον καὶ ταῦρος καὶ λέων ἅμα βοσκηθήσονται, καὶ παιδίον μικρὸν ἄξει αὐτούς·
καὶ βοῦς καὶ ἄρκος ἅμα βοσκηθήσονται, καὶ ἅμα τὰ παιδία αὐτῶν βοσκηθήσονται, καὶ λεὼν καὶ βοῦς ἅμα φάγονται ἄχυρα·
καὶ παιδίον νήπιον ἐπὶ τρώγλην ἀσπίδων, καὶ ἐπὶ κοίτην ἐκγόνων ἀσπίδων τὴν χεῖρα ἐπιβαλεῖ.
καὶ οὔ μὴ κακοποιήσωσιν, οὐδ’ οὗ μὴ δύνωνται ἀπολέσαι οὐδένα ἐπὶ τὸ ὅρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου, ὅτι ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ σύμπασα τοῦ γνῶναι τὸν κύριον, ὡς ὕδωρ πολὺ κατακαλύψαι θαλάσσας.
καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἦ ῥίζα τοῦ Ἰεσσαὶ καὶ ὁ ἀνιστάμενος ἄρχειν ἐθνῶν, ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν.
καὶ ἔσται ἡ ἀνάπαυσις αὐτοῦ τιμή.
Καὶ Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ προσθήσει Κύριος τοῦ δεῖξαι τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ τοῦ ζηλῶσαι τὸ καταλειφθὲν ὑπόλοιπον τοῦ λαοῦ, ὃ ἂν καταλειφθῇ ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων καὶ ἀπὸ Αἰγύπτου καὶ Βαβυλωνίας καὶ Αἰθιοπίας καὶ ἀπὸ Αἰλαμιτῶν καὶ ἀπὸ ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν καὶ ἐξ Ἀραβείας.
καὶ ἀρεῖ σημεῖον εἰς τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ συνάξει τοὺς ἀπολομένους Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τοὺς διεσπαρμένους Ἰούδα συνάξει ἐκ τῶν τεσσάρων πτερύγων τῆς γῆς.
καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται ὁ ζῆλος Ἐφράιμ, καὶ οἱ ἐχθροὶ Ἰούδα ἀπολοῦνται·
Ἐφράιμ οὐ ζηλώσει Ἰούδαν, καὶ Ἰούδας οὗ θλίψει Ἐφράιμ.
καὶ πετασθήσονται ἐν πλοίοις ἀλλοφύλων·
θάλασσαν ἅμα προνομεύσουσιν καὶ τοὺς ἀφ’ ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν καὶ Ἰδουμαίαν, καὶ ἐπὶ Μωὰβ πρῶτον τὰς χεῖρας ἐπιβαλοῦσιν, οἶ δὲ υἱοὶ Αμμὼν πρῶτοι ὑπακούσονται.
καὶ ἐρημώσει Κύριος τὴν θάλασσαν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐπιβαλεῖ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν ποταμὸν πνεύματι βιαίῳ, καὶ πατάξει ἑπτὰ φάραγγας ὥστε διαπορεύεσθαι αὐτὸν ἐν ὑποδήμασιν·
καὶ ἔσται ὁδὸς τῷ καταλειφθέντι μου λαῷ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἔσται τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα ὅτε ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου.
Καὶ ἐρεῖς ἓν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ.
ἐκείνῃ Εὐλογήσω σε, Κύριε, διότι ὠργίσθης μοι, καὶ ἀπέστρεψας τὸν θυμόν σου καὶ ἠλέησάς με.
ἰδοὺ ὃ θεός μου σωτήρ μου, πεποιθὼς ἔσομαι ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ οὔ φοβηθήσομαι·
διότι ἡ δόξα μου καὶ ἡ αἴνεσίς μου Κύριος, καὶ ἐγένετό μοι εἷς σωτηρίαν.
καὶ ἀντλήσετε ὕδωρ μετ’ εὐφροσύνης ἐκ τῶν πηγῶν τοῦ σωτηρίου.
καὶ ἐρεῖς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ Ὑμνεῖτε Κύριον, βοᾶτε τὸ ὄνομα αὑτοῦ, ἀναγγείλατε ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν τὰ ἔνδοξα αὐτοῦ·
μιμνήσκεσθε ὅτι ὑψώθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ.
ὑμνήσατε τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, ὅτι ὑψηλὰ ἐποίησεν·
ἀναγγείλατε ταῦτα ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε καὶ εὐφραίνεσθε, οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Σιών, ὅτι ὑψώθη ὃ ἅγιος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν μέσῳ σου.
Ὅρασις ἦν εἶδεν Ἠσαίας υἱὸς Ἀμὼς κατὰ Βαβυλῶνος.
Ἐπ᾿ ὅρους πεδινοῦ ἄρατε σημεῖον, υψώσατε τὴν φωνὴν ἑαυτοῖς, μὴ φοβεῖσθε·
παρακαλεῖτε τῇ <χειρί>.
ἀνοίξατε, οἱ ἄρχοντες.
ἐγὼ συντάσσω, καὶ ἐγώ, αὑτούς·
ἡγιασμένοι εἰσίν, καὶ ἐγὼ ἄγω αὐτούς·
γίγαντες ἔρχονται πληρῶσαι τὸν θυμόν μου χαίροντες ἅμα καὶ ὑβρίζοντες.
φωνὴ ἐθνῶν πολλῶν ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων, ὁμοία ἐθνῶν πολλῶν, φωνὴ βασιλέων καὶ ἐθνῶν συνηγμένων.
Κύριος σαβαὼθ ἐντέταλται ἔθνει ὁπλομάχῳ ἔρχεσθαι ἐκ γῆς πόρρωθεν ἀπ’ ἄκρου θεμελίου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, Κύριος καὶ οἱ ὁπλομάχοι αὐτοῦ, τοῦ καταφθεῖραι τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅλην.
ὀλολύζετε·
ἐγγὺς γὰρ ἡ ἡμέρα Κυρίου, καὶ συντριβὴ παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ ἥξει.
διὰ τοῦτο <πᾶσα χεὶρ> ἐκλυθήσεται, καὶ πᾶσα ψυχὴ ἀνθρώπου δειλιάσει·
καὶ ταραχθήσονται οἱ πρέσβεις, καὶ ὠδῖνες αὐτοὺς ἕξουσιν ὡς γυναικὸς τικτούσης·
καὶ συμφοράσουσιν ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον καὶ ἐκστήσονται, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν ὡς φλὸξ μεταβαλοῦσιν.
Ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἡ ἡμέρα Κυρίου ἀνίατος ἔρχεται θυμοῦ καὶ ὀργῆς, θεῖναι τὴν οἰκουμένην ἔρημον καὶ τοὺς ἁμαρτωλοὺς ἀπολέσω ἐξ αὐτῆς.
οἱ γὰρ ἀστέρες τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ὁ Ὠρίων καὶ πᾶς ὁ κόσμος τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τὸ φῶς οὐ δώσουσιν, καὶ σκοτισθήσεται τοῦ ἡλίου ἀνατέλλοντος, καὶ ἡ σελήνη οὐ δώσει τὸ φῶς αὐτῆς.
καὶ ἐντελοῦμαι τῇ οἰκουμένῃ ὅλῃ κακά, καὶ τοῖς ἀσεβέσι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν·
καὶ ἀπολῶ ὕβριν ἀνόμων, καὶ ὕβριν ὑπερηφάνων ταπεινώσω.
καὶ ἔσονται οἱ καταλελιμμένοι ἔντιμοι μᾶλλον ἢ τὸ χρυσίον τὸ ἄπυρον, καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος μᾶλλον ἔντιμος ἔσται ἢ ὁ λίθος ὁ ἐκ Σουφείρ.
ὁ γὰρ οὐρανὸς θυμωθήσεται, καὶ ἡ γῆ σεισθήσεται ἐκ τῶν θεμελίων αὐτῆς, διὸ, θυμὸν ὀργῆς Κυρίου σαβαώθ, τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἂν ἐπέλθῃ ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ.
καὶ ἔσονται οἱ καταλελιμμένοι ὡς δορκάδων φεῦγον καὶ ὡς πρόβατον πλανώμενον, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ συνάγων, ὥστε ἄνθρωπον εἰς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἀποστραφῆναι, καὶ ἄνθρωπον εἰς τὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ διῶξαι.
ὃς γὰρ ἐὰν ἁλῷ ἡττηθήσεται, καὶ ὅσοι συνηγμένοι εἰσὶν μαχαίρᾳ πεσοῦνται.
καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν ῥάξουσιν, καὶ τὰς οἰκίας αὐτῶν προνομεύσουσιν, καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν ἕξουσιν.
ἰδοὺ ἐπεγείρω ὑμῖν τοὺς Μήδους, οἳ οὐ λογίζονται ἀργύριον οὐδὲ χρυσίου χρείαν ἔχουσιν.
τοξεύματα νεανίσκων συντρίψουσιν, καὶ τὸ, τέκνα ὑμῶν οὐ μὴ ἐλεήσουσιν, οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τοῖς τέκνοις σου φείσονται οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν.
καὶ ἔσται Βαβυλών, ἣ καλεῖται ἔνδοξος ὑπὸ βασιλέως Χαλδαίων, ὃν τρόπον κατέστρεψεν ὁ θεὸς Σόδομα καὶ Γόμορρα.
οὐ κατοικηθήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον, οὐδὲ μὴ εἰσέλθωσιν εἰς αὐτὴν διὰ πολλῶν γενεῶν, οὐδὲ μὴ διέλθωσιν αὐτὴν Ἄραβες, οὐδὲ ποιμένες οὐ μὴ ἀναπαύσεωνται ἐν αὐτῇ.
καὶ ἀναπαύσονται ἐκεῖ θηρία, καὶ πλησθήσονται οἰκίαι ἤχου·
καὶ ἀναπαύσονται ἐκεῖ σειρῆνες, καὶ δαιμόνια ἐκεῖ ὀρχήσονται, καὶ ὀνοκένταυροι ἐκεῖ κατοικήσουσιν, καὶ νοσσοποιήσουσιν ἐχῖνοι ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις αὐτῶν.
ταχὺ ἔρχεται καὶ οὐ χρονιεῖ.
Καὶ ἐλεήσει Κύριος τὸν Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἐκλέξεται ἔτι τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀναπαύσονται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ ὁ γειώρας προστεθήσεται πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ ρποστεθήσεται ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰακώβ, καὶ λήμψονται αὐτοὺς ἔθνη καὶ εἰσάξουσιν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν, καὶ κατακληρονομήσουσιν, καὶ πληθυνήσονται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς δούλους καὶ δούλας·
καὶ ἔσονται αἰχμάλωτοι οἱ αἰχμαλωτεύσαντες αὐτούς, καὶ κυριευθήσονται οἱ κυριεύσαντες αὐτῶν.
Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἑμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀναπαύσει σε ὁ θεὸς ἐκ τῆς ὀδύνης καὶ τοῦ θυμοῦ σοῦ καὶ τῆς δουλίας τῆς σκληρᾶς ἧς ἐδούλευσας αὐτοῖς.
καὶ λήμψῃ τὸν θρῆνον τοῦτον ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐρεῖς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ Πῶς ἀναπέπαυται ὁ ἀπαιτῶν, καὶ ἀναπέπαυται ὁ ἐπισπουδαστής;
συνέτριψεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν ζυγὸν τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν, τὸν ζυγὸν τῶν ἀρχόντων·
πατάζας ἔθνος θυμῷ, πληγῇ ἀνιάτῳ, παίων ἔθνος πληγὴν θυμοῦ ἣ οὐκ ἐφείσατο, ἀνεπαύσατο πεποιθώς.
πᾶσα ἡ γῆ βοᾷ μετ’ εὐφροσύνης, καὶ τὰ ξύλα τοῦ Λιβάνου ηὐφράνθησαν ἐπὶ σοὶ καὶ ἡ κέδρος τοῦ Λιβάνου Ἀφ᾿ οὗ σὺ κεκοίμησαι, οὐκ ἀνέβη ὁ κόπτων ἡμᾶς.
ὁ ᾄδης κάτωθεν ἐπικράνθη συναντήσας σοι·
συνηγέρθησάν σοι πάντες οἱ γίγαντες οἱ ἄρξαντες τῆς γῆς, οἱ ἐγείραντες ἐκ τῶν θρόνων αὐτῶν πάντας βασιλεῖς ἐθνῶν.
πάντες ἀποκριθήσονται καὶ ἐροῦσίν σοι Καὶ σὺ ἑάλως ὥσπερ καὶ ἡμεῖς, ἐν ἡμῖν δὲ κατελογίσθης.
κατέβη δὲ εἰς ᾅδου ἡ δόξα σου, ἡ πολλὴ εὐφροσύνη σου·
ὑποκάτω σου στρώσουσιν σῆψιν, καὶ τὸ κατακάλυμμά σου σκώληξ.
πῶς ἐξέπεσεν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ὁ ἑωσφόρος ὁ πρωὶ ἀνατέλλων;
συνετρίβη εἰς τὴν γῆν ὁ ἀποστέλλων πρὸς πάντα τὰ, ἔθνη.
σὺ δὲ εἶπας ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ σου Εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀναβήσομαι, ἐπάνω τῶν ἄστρων τοῦ οὐρανοῦ θήσω τὸν θρόνον μου, καθιῶ ἐν ὄρει ὑψηλῷ ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρη τὸ, ὑψηλὰ τὰ πρὸς βορρᾶν, ἀναβήσομαι ἐπάνω τῶν νεφελῶν, ἔσομαι ὅμοιος τῷ ὑψίστῳ.
νῦν δὲ εἷς ᾅδου καταβήσῃ καὶ εἰς τὰ θεμέλια τῆς γῆς.
οἱ ἰδόντες σε θαυμάσουσιν ἐπὶ σοὶ καὶ ἐροῦσιν Οὗτος ὁ ἅνθρωπος ὁ παροξύνων τὴν γῆν, σείων βασιλεῖς, ὁ θεὶς τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅλην ἔρημον, καὶ καὶ τὰς πόλεις καθεῖλεν, τοὺς ἐν ἐπαγωγῇ οὐκ ἔλυσεν.
πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐκοιμήθησαν ἐν τιμῇ, ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ.
σὺ δὲ ῥιφήσῃ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν, ὡς νεκρὸς ἐβδελυγμένος, μετὰ.
πολλῶν τεθνηκότων ἐκκεκεντημένων μαχαίραις καταβαινόντων εἰς ᾅδου.
ὃν τρόπον ἐν αἵματι ἱμάτιον πεφυρμένον οὐκ ἔσται καθαρόν, οὔτως οὐδὲ σὺ ἔσῃ καθαρός, διότι τὴν γῆν μου ἀπώλεσας καὶ τὸν λαόν μου ἀπέκτεινας·
οὐ μὴ μείνῃς εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον, σπέρμα πονηρόν.
ἑτοίμασον σφαγῆναι τὰ τέκνα σου ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις τοῦ πατρός σου, ἵνα μὴ ἀναστῶσιν καὶ τὴν γῆν κληρονομήσωσιν καὶ ἐπαναστήσομαι τὴν γῆν πολέμων.
καὶ ἐπαναστήσομαι αὐτοῖς, λέγει Κύριος σαβαώθ, καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτῶν ὄνομα καὶ κατάλειμμα καὶ σπέρμα·
τάδε λέγει Κύριος.
καὶ θήσω τὴν Βαβυλωνίαν ἔρημον, ὥστε κατοικεῖν ἐχίνους, καὶ ἔσται εἰς οὐδέν·
καὶ θήσω αὐτὴν πηλοῦ< βάραθρον> εἰς ἀπώλειαν.
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος σαβαώθ Ὃν τρόπον εἴρηκα οὕτως ἔσται, καὶ ὃν τρόπον βεβούλευμαι οὕτως μενεῖ, τοῦ ἀπολέσαι τοὺς Ἀσσυρίους ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς τῆς ἐμῆς καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ὀρέων μου·
καὶ ἔσονται ἐς καταπάτημα, καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ ζυγὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ τό κῦδος αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῶν ὤμων ἀφαιρεθήσεται.
αὔτη ἡ βουλὴ ἥν βεβούλευται Κύριος ἐπὶ τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅλην, καὶ αὕτη ἡ χεὶρ ἡ ὑψηλὴ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς οἰκουμένης.
ἃ γὰρ ὁ θεὸς ὁ ἅγιος βεβούλευται τίς διασκεδάσει;
καὶ τὴν χεῖρα τὴν ὑψηλὴν τίς ἀποστρέψει;
Τοῦ ἔτους οὗ ἀπέθανεν Ἀχὰζ ὁ βασιλεὺς τό ῥῆμα τοῦτο.
Μὴ εὐφρανθείητε, πάντες οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, συνετρίβη γὰρ ὁ ζυγός τοῦ παίοντος ὑμᾶς·
ἐκ γὰρ σπέρματος ὄφεων ἐξελεύσεται ἔγγονα ἀσπίδων, καὶ τὰ, ἔκγονα αὐτῶν ἐξελεύσονται ὄφεις πετόμενοι.
καὶ βοσκηθήσονται πτωχοὶ δι’ αὐτοῦ·
πτωχοὶ δὲ ἄνδρες ἐπ’ εἰρήνης ἀναπαύσονται·
ἀνελεῖ δὲ λιμῷ τὸ σπέρμα σου, καὶ τὸ κατάλιμμά σου ἀνελεῖ.
ὀλολύζετε, πύλαι πόλεων, κεκραγέτωσαν πόλεις τεταραγμέναι, οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι πάντες, ὅτι καπνὸς ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἔρχεται, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν τοῦ εἶναι.
καὶ τι ἀποκριθήσονται βασιλεῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν;
ὅτι Κύριος ἐθεμελίωσεν Σιών, καὶ δι’ αὐτοῦ σωθήσονται οἱ ταπεινοὶ τοῦ λαοῦ.
Τὸ ὅραμα τὸ κατὰ τῆς Μωαβίτιδος.
Νυκτὸς ἀπολεῖται ἡ Μωαβῖτις, νυκτὸς γὰρ ἀπολεῖται τὸ τεῖχος τῆς Μωαβίτιδος.
λυπεῖσθε ἐφ’ ἑαυτοῖς, ἀπολεῖται γὰρ Δαιβηδών, οὗ ὁ βωμὸς ὑμῶν·
ἐκεῖ ἀναβήσεσθε κλαίειν, ἐπὶ Ναβαῦ τῆς Μωαβίτιδος.
ὀλολύζετε, ἐπὶ πάσης κεφαλῆς φαλάκρωμα, πάντες βραχίονες κατατετμημένοι, ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις αὐτῆς περιζώσασθε σάκκους, καὶ κόπτεσθε ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις αὐτῆς καὶ ἐν ταῖς ῥύμαις αὑτῆς, πάντες ὀλολύζετε μετὰ κλαυθμοῦ.
ὅτι κέκραγεν Ἑσεβὼν καὶ <Ἐλεαλή>, ἕως ἠκούσθη ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς·
διὰ τοῦτο ἡ ὀσφὺς τῆς Μωαβίτιδος βοᾷ, ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῆς γνώσεται.
δὴ καρδία τῆς Μωαβίτιδος ἐν ἑαυτῇ ἕως Σήγωρ·
δάμαλις γὰρ ἐστὶν τριετής·
ἐπὶ δὲ τῆς ἀναβάσεως τῆς πρὸς σὲ κλαίοντες ἀναβήσονται τῇ ὁδῷ Ἀδωνίειμ·
βοᾷ σύντριμμα καὶ σεισμός, τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς Νεμρεὶμ ἔρημον ἔσται, καὶ ὃ χόρτος αὐτῆς ἐκλείψει·
χόρτος γὰρ χλωρὸς οὐκ ἔσται.
μὴ καὶ οὕτως μέλλει σωθῆναι;
ἐπάξω γὰρ ἐπὶ τὴν φάραγγα Ἄραβας, καὶ λήμψονται αὐτήν.
συνῆψεν γὰρ ἡ τὸ ὅρος τῆς Μωαβίτιδος τῆς Ἀγαλλείμ, καὶ ὀλολυγμὸς αὐτῆς ἕως τοῦ φρέατος τοῦ Αἰλείμ.
τὸ δὲ ὕδωρ τό ῾Ρεμμὼν πλησθήσεται αἵματος·
ἐπάξω γὰρ ἐπὶ ῾Ρεμμὼν Ἄραβας, καὶ ἀρῶ τό σπέρμα Μωὰβ καὶ Ἀριὴλ καὶ τό κατάλοιπον Ἀδαμά.
Ἀποστελῶ ὡς ἑρπετὰ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν·
μὴ πέτρα ἔρημός ἐστιν τὸ ὅρος Σιών;
ἔσῌ γὰρ ὡς πετεινοῦ ἀνιπταμένου νεοσσὸς ἀφῃρημένος, θυγάτηρ Μωάβ·
ἐπὶ τάδε, Ἀρνών, πλείονα βουλεύου, ποίει τε σκέπην πένθους αὐτῇ διὸ.
παντός·
ἐν μεσημβρινῇ σκοτιᾷ φεύγουσιν, ἐξέστησαν·
μὴ ἀχθῇς.
παροικήσουσιν οἱ φυγάδες Μωάβ·
ἔσονται γὰρ σκέπη ὑμῖν ἀπὸ προσώπου διώκοντος, ὅτι ἤρθη ἡ συμμαχία σου, συνετελέσθη ταλαιπωρία, καὶ ὃ ἅρχων ἀπώλετο ὁ καταπατῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
καὶ διορθωθήσεται μετὰ.
ἐλέους θρόνος, καὶ καθιεῖται ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ μετὰ ἀληθείας ἐν σκηνῇ Δαυείδ, κρίνων καὶ ἐκζητῶν κρίμα καὶ σπεύδων δικαιοσύνην.
Ἠκούσαμεν τὴν ὕβριν Μωάβ, ὑβριστὴς σφόδρα, τὴν ὑπερηφανίαν ἐξῆρας.
οὐχ οὕτως ἡ μαντεία σου, οὐχ οὕτως.
ὀλολύξει Μωάβ, ἐν γὰρ τῇ Μωαβίτιδι πάντες ὀλολύξουσιν·
τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Δέσεθ μελετήσεις, καὶ οὐκ ἐντραπήσῃ.
τὰ πεδία Ἑσεβὼν πενθήσει, ἄμπελος Σεβαμά·
καταπίνοντες τὰ ἔθνη, καταπατήσατε τὰς ἀμπέλους αὐτῆς ἕως Ἰαζήρ·
οὐ μὴ συνάψητε, πλανήθητε τὴν ἕρημον·
οἱ ἀπεσταλμένοι ἐγκατελείφθησαν, διέβησαν γὰρ τὴν ἔρημον.
διὰ τοῦτο κλαύσομαι ὡς τὸν κλαυθμὸν Ἰαζὴρ ἄμπελον Σεβαμά·
τὰ δένδρα σου κατέβαλεν Ἑσεβὼν καὶ <Ἐλεαλή>, ἐπὶ τῷ θερισμῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ τρυγητῷ σου καταπατήσω, καὶ πάντα πεσοῦνται.
καὶ ἀρθήσεται εὐφροσύνη καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα ἐκ τῶν ἀμπελώνων σου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀμπελῶσίν σου οὐ μὴ εὐφρανθήσονται, καὶ οὐ μὴ πατήσουσιν οἶνον εἰς τὰ.
ὑπολήνια.
πέπαυται γάρ.
διὰ τοῦτο ἡ κοιλία μου ἐπὶ Μωὰβ ὡς κιθάρα ἠχήσει, καὶ τὰ ἐντός μου ὡσεὶ τεῖχος ὃ ἐνεκαίνισας.
καὶ ἔσται ὡς τὸ ἐντραπῆναί σε, ἐκοπίασεν Μωὰβ ἐπὶ τοῖς βωμοῖς, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὰ.
χειροποίητα αὐτῆς ὥστε προσεύξασθαι, καὶ οὗ μὴ δύνηται ἐξελέσθαι αὐτόν.
τοῦτο τὸ ὃ ἐλάλησεν Κύριος ἐπὶ Μωάβ, ὁπότε καὶ ἐλάλησεν.
καὶ νῦν λέγω Ἐν τρισὶν ἔτεσΐν ἐτῶν μισθωτοῦ ἀτιμασθήσεται ἡ δόξα Μωὰβ ἐν παντὶ τῷ πλούτῳ τῷ πολλῷ, καὶ καταλειφθήσεται ὀλιγοστὸς καὶ οὐκ ἔντιμος.
Τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ κατὰ.
Δαμασκοῦ.
Ἰδοὺ Δαμασκὸς ἀρθήσεται ἀπὸ πόλεων, καὶ ἔσται εἰς πτῶσιν, καταλελιμμένη εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, εἰς κοίτην ποιμνίων καὶ ἀνάπαυσιν βουκολίων, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ διώκων·
καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσται ὀχυρὰ τοῦ καταφυγεῖν Ἐφράιμ·
καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσται βασιλεία ἐν Δαμασκῷ, καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν τῶν Σύρων ἀπολεῖται·
οὐ γὰρ σὺ βελτίων εἷ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ καὶ τῆς δόξης αὐτῶν.
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος σαβαώθ Ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔκλειψις τῆς δόξης Ἰακώβ, καὶ τὰ πίονα τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ σεισθήσεται.
καὶ ἔσται ὅν τρόπον ἐάν τις συναγάγῃ ἀμητὸν ἑστηκότα καὶ σπέρμα σταχύων ἐν τῷ βραχίονι αὐτοῦ ἀμήσῃ.
καὶ ἔσται ὃν τρόπον ἐάν τις συναγάγῃ στάχυν ἐν φάραγγι στερεᾷ, καὶ καταλειφθῇ ἒν αὐτῇ καλάμη, ἢ ὡς ῥῶγες ἐλαίας δύο ἢ τρεῖς ἐπ’ ἄκρου μετεώρου, ἦ τέσσαρες ἢ πέντε ἐπὶ τῶν κλάδων αὐτοῦ καταλειφθῇ.
τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ἰσραήλ.
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ πεποιθὼς ἔσται ἅνθρωπος ἐπὶ τῷ ποιήσαντι αὐτόν, οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐμβλέψονται, καὶ οὐ μὴ πεποιθότες ὦσιν ἐπὶ τοῖς βωμοῖς οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν ἅ ἐποίησαν οἱ δάκτυλοι οὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ὄψονται τὰ.
ἄλση αὐτῶν οὐδὲ τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῶν.
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσονται αἱ πόλεις σου ἐγκαταλελιμμέναι ὃν τρόπον ἐγκατέλιπον οἱ Ἀμορραῖοι καὶ οἱ Εὑαῖοι ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ·
καὶ ἔσονται ἔρημοι·
διότι ἐγκατέλιπες τὸν θεὸν τὸν σωτῆρά σου, καὶ Κυρίου τοῦ βοηθοῦ σου οὐκ ἐμνήσθης.
διὰ τοῦτο φυτεύσεις φύτευμα ἄπιστον καὶ σπέρμα ἄπιστον·
τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ ᾖ ἂν φυτεύσῃς, πλανηθήσῃ·
τὸ δὲ πρωὶ ἐὰν <σπείρῃς>, ἀνθήσει εἷς ἀμητόν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ κληρώσῃ, καὶ ὥσπερ πατὴρ ἀνθρώπου κληρώσῃ τοῖς υἱοῖς.
Οὐαὶ πλῆθος ἐθνῶν πολλῶν·
ὡς θάλασσα κυμαίνουσα, οὕτως ταραχθήσεσθε, καὶ νῶτος ἐθνῶν πολλῶν ὡς ὕδωρ ἠχήσει·
ὡς ὕδωρ πολὺ ἔθνη πολλά, ὡς ὕδατος πολλοῦ βίᾳ.
καταφερομένου.
καὶ ἀποσκορακιεῖ αὐτόν, καὶ πόρρω αὐτὸν διώξεται ὡς χνοῦν ἀχύρου λικμώντων ἀπέναντι ἀνέμου, καὶ ὡς κονιορτὸν τροχοῦ καταιγὶς φέρουσα.
πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἔσται πένθος·
πρὶν ἦ πρωί, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται.
αὕτη ἡ μερὶς τῶν ὑμᾶς προνομευσάντων, καὶ κληρονομία τῶν ὑμᾶς κληρονομησάντων.
Οὐαὶ γῆς πλοίων πτέρυγες ἐπέκεινα ποταμῶν Αἰθιοπίας, ὁ ἀποστέλλων ἐν θαλάσσῃ ὅμηρα καὶ ἐπιστολὰς βυβλίνας ἐπάνω τοῦ ὕδατος.
πορεύσονται γὰρ ἄγγελοι κοῦφοι πρὸς ἔθνος μετέωρον, καὶ ξένον λαὸν καὶ χαλεπόν·
τί αὐτοῦ ἐπέκεινα,- ἔθνος ἀνέλπιστον καὶ καταπεπατημένον.
νῦν οἱ ποταμοὶ Τῆς γῆς πάντες ὡς χώρα κατοικουμένη κατοικηθήσεται·
ἡ χώρα αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ σημεῖον ἀπὸ ὅρους ἀρθῇ, ὡς σάλπιγγος φωνὴ ἀκουστὸν ἔσται.
ὅτι οὕτως εἶπέν μοι Κύριος Ἀσφάλεια ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἐμῇ πόλει ὡς φῶς καύματος μεσημβρίας, καὶ ὡς νεφέλη δρόσου ἡμέρας ἀμήτου ἔσται.
πρὸ τοῦ θερισμοῦ, ὅταν συντελεσθῇ ἄνθος, καὶ ὄμφαξ ἀνθήσῃ ἄνθος ὀμφακίζουσα·
καὶ ἀφελεῖ τὸ.
βοτρύδια τὰ μικρὰ τοῖς δρεπάνοις, καὶ τὰς κληματίδας ἀφελεῖ καὶ κατακόψει, καὶ καταλείψει ἅμα τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς·
καὶ συναχθήσεται ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ παντᾶ τὸ.
θηρία τῆς γῆς ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἥξει.
ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀνενεχθήσεται δῶρα Κυρίῳ σαβαὼθ ἐκ λαοῦ τεθλιμμένου καὶ τετιλμένου, καὶ ἀπὸ λαοῦ μεγάλου ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον·
ἔθνος ἐλπίζον καὶ καταπεπατημένον, ὅ ἐστιν ἐν μέρει τοῦ ποταμοῦ τῆς χώρας αὑτοῦ, εἷς τὸν τόπον οὗ τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου σαβαώθ, ὅρος Σιών.
Ὅρασις Αἰγύπτου.
Ἰδοὺ Κύριος κάθηται ἐπὶ νεφέλης κούφης καὶ ἥξει εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ σεισθήσεται τὰ χειροποίητα Αἰγύπτου ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ καρδίαι αὐτῶν ἡττηθήσονται ἐν αὐτοῖς.
καὶ ἐπεγερθήσονται Αἰγύπτιοι ἐπ’ Αἰγυπτίους, καὶ πολεμήσει ἄνθρωπος τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἅνθρωπος τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ, ἐπεγερθήσεται πόλις ἐπὶ πόλιν καὶ νομὸς ἐπὶ νομόν.
καὶ ταραχθήσεται τὸ πνεῦμα τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν διασκεδάσω, καὶ ἐπερωτήσουσιν τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἀγάλματα αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς γῆς φωνοῦντας καὶ τοὺς ἐνγαστριμύθους καὶ τοὺς γνώστας.
καὶ παραδώσω Αἴγυπτον εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων κυρίων σκληρῶν, καὶ βασιλεῖς σκληροὶ κυριεύσουσιν αὐτῶν.
τάδε λέγει Κύριος σαβαώθ.
καὶ πίονται οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ὕδωρ τὸ παρὰ θάλασσαν, ὁ δὲ ποταμὸς ἐκλείψει καὶ ξηρανθήσεται·
καὶ ἐκλείψουσιν οἱ ποταμοὶ καὶ αἱ διώρυγες τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ ἐκλείχουσιν πᾶσα συναγωγὴ ὕδατος καὶ ἐν παντὶ ἕλει καλάμου καὶ παπύρου, καὶ τὸ ἄχι τὸ χλωρὸν πᾶν τὸ κύκλῳ τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ πᾶν τὸ σπειρόμενον διὰ, τοῦ ποταμοῦ ξηρανθήσεται ἀνεμόφθορον.
καὶ στενάξουσιν οἱ ἁλεεῖς, καὶ στενάξουσιν πάντες οἱ βάλλοντες ἄγκιστρον εἰς τὸν ποταμόν, καὶ οἱ βάλλοντες σαγήνας καὶ οἱ ἀμφιβολεῖς πενθήσουσιν.
καὶ αἰσχύνη λήμψεται τοὺς ἐργαζομένους τὸ λίνον τὸ σχιστὸν καὶ τοὺς ἐργαζομένους τὴν βύσσον, καὶ ἔσονται οἱ διαζόμενοι αὐτὰ ἐν ὀδύνῃ, καὶ πάντες οἱ τὸν ζῦθον ποιοῦντες λυπηθήσονται καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς πονέσουσιν.
καὶ μωροὶ ἔσονται οἱ ἄρχοντες Τάνεως·
οἱ σοφοὶ σύμβουλοι τοῦ βασιλέως, ἡ βουλὴ αὐτῶν μωρανθήσεται.
πῶς ἐρεῖτε τῷ βασιλεῖ Υἱοὶ συνετῶν ἡμεῖς, υἱοὶ βασιλέων τῶν ἐξ ἀρχῆς;
ποῦ εἰσιν νῦν οἱ σοφοί σου;
καὶ ἀναγγειλάτωσάν σοι καὶ εἰπάτωσαν τί βεβούλευται Κύριος σαβαὼθ ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον.
ἐξέλιπον οἱ ἄρχοντες Τάνεως, καὶ ὑψώθησαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Μέμφεως, καὶ πλανήσουσιν Αἴγυπτον κατὰ φυλάς.
Κύριος γὰρ ἐκέρασεν αὐτοῖς πνεῦμα πλανήσεως, καὶ ἐπλάνησαν Αἴγυπτον ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτῶν, ὡς πλανᾶται ὃ μεθύων καὶ ὃ ἐμῶν ἅμα.
καὶ οὐκ ἔσται τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις ἔργον ὃ ποιήσει κεφαλὴν καὶ οὐράν, ἀρχὴν καὶ τέλος.
Τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ.
ἐκείνῃ ἔσονται οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ὡς γυναῖκες ἐν φόβῳ καὶ ἐν τρόμῳ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς χειρὸς Κυρίου σαβαὼθ ἢν αὐτὸς ἐπιβαλεῖ αὐτοῖς.
καὶ ἔσται ἡ χώρα τῶν Ἰουδαίων τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις εἷς φόβητρον·
πᾶς ὃς ἂν ὀνομάσῃ αὐτὴν αὐτοῖς, φοβηθήσονται διὰ τὴν βουλὴν Κυρίου σαβαώθ, ἣν βεβούλευται Κύριος ἐπ’ αὐτήν.
Τῆ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσονται πέντε πόλεις ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ λαλοῦσαι τῇ γλώσσῃ τῇ Χανανίτιδι καὶ ὀμνύουσαι τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου·
πόλις ἁσεδὲκ κληθήσεται ἦ μία πόλις.
Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῷ κυρίῳ ἐν χώρᾳ Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ στήλη πρὸς τὸ ὅριον αὐτῆς τῷ κυρίῳ, καὶ ἔσται εἰς σημεῖον εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα Κυρίῳ ἐν χώρᾳ Αἰγύπτου·
ὅτι κεκράξονται πρὸς Κύριον διὰ τοὺς θλίβοντας αὐτούς, καὶ ἀποστελεῖ αὐτοῖς Κύριος ἄνθρωπον ὃς σώσει αὐτούς, κρίνων σώσει αὐτούς.
καὶ γνωστὸς ἔσται Κύριος τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις·
καὶ γνώσονται οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τὸν κύριον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ποιήσουσιν θυσίας, καί εὔξονται εὐχὰς τῷ κυρίῳ καὶ ἀποδώσουσιν.
καὶ πατάξει Κύριος τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους πληγῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἰάσεται αὐτοὺς ἰάσει, καὶ ἐπιστραφήσονται πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἐπακούσεται αὐτῶν καὶ ἰάσεται αὐτούς.
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται ὁδὸς Αἰγύπτου πρὸς Ἀσσυρίους, καὶ εἰσελεύσονται Ἀσσύριοι εἷς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ Αἰγύπτιοι πορεύσονται πρὸς Ἀσσυρίους, καὶ δουλεύσουσιν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τοῖς Ἀσσυρίοις.
Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται Ἰσραὴλ τρίτος ἐν τοῖς Ἀσσυρίοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις, εὐλογημένος ἐν τῇ γῇ ᾗ εὐλόγησεν Κύριος σαβαὼθ λέγων Εὐλογημένος ὅ λαός μου ὃ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ὅ ἐν Ἀσσυρίοις, καὶ ἡ κληρονομία μου Ἰσραήλ.
Τοῦ ἔτους οὗ εἰσῆλθεν Ναθὰν εἰς Ἄζωτον, ἡνίκα ἀπεστάλη ὑπὸ Ἀρνὰ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ἐπολέμησεν τὴν Ἄζωτον καὶ κατελάβετο αὐτήν, τότε ἐλάλησεν Κύριος πρὸς Ἠσαίαν λέγων Πορεύου καὶ ἄφελε τὸν σάκκον ἀπὸ τῆς ὀσφύος σου, καὶ τὸ.
σανδάλιά σου ὑπόλυσαι ἀπὸ τῶν ποδῶν σου, καὶ ποίησον οὕτως, πορευόμενος γυμνὸς καὶ ἀνυπόδητος.
καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος Ὃν τρόπον πεπόρευται Ἠσαίας ὁ παῖς μου γυμνὸς καὶ ἀνυπόδετος, τρία ἔτη ἔσται σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις καὶ Αἰθίοψιν·
ὅτι οὕτως ἄξει βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν Αἰγύπτου καὶ Αἰθιόπων, νεανίσκους καὶ πρεσβύτας, γυμνοὺς καὶ ἀνυποδέτους, ἀνακεκαλυμμένους, τὴν αἰσχύνην Αἰγύπτου.
καὶ αἰσχυνθήσονται ἡττηθέντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἐπὶ τοῖς Αἰθίοψιν, ἐφ’ οἷς ἦσαν πεποιθότες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, ἦσαν γὰρ αὐτοῖς δόξα.
καὶ ἐροῦσιν οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ταύτῃ Ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς ἦμεν πεποιθότες τοῦ φυγεῖν εἰς αὐτοὺς εἰς βοήθειαν, οἳ οὐκ ἠδύναντο σωθῆναι ἀπὸ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων·
καὶ πῶς ἡμεῖς σωθησόμεθα;
Τὸ ὅραμα τῆς ἐρήμου.
Ὡς καταιγὶς δι’ ἐρήμου διέλθοι, ἐξ ἐρήμου ἐρχομένη ἐκ γῆς, φοβερὸν τὸ ὅραμα, καὶ σκληρὸν ἀνηγγέλη μοι.
ὃ ἀθετῶν ἀθετεῖ, ὁ ἀνομῶν ἀνομεῖ.
ἐπ’ ἐμοὶ οἶ Ἐλαμεῖται, καὶ οἱ πρέσβεις τῶν Περσῶν ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ἔρχονται.
νῦν στενάξω καὶ παρακαλέσω ἐμαυτόν.
διὰ τοῦτο ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ ὀσφύς μου ἐκλύσεως, καὶ ὠδῖνες ἔλαβόν με ὡς τὴν τίκτουσαν·
ἠδίκησα τὸ μὴ ἀκοῦσαι, ἐσπούδασα τὸ μὴ βλέπειν.
ἡ καρδία μου πλανᾶται καὶ ἡ ἀνομία με βαπτίζει, ἡ μου ἐφέστηκεν εἰς φόβον.
ἑτοίμασον τὴν τράπεζαν, πίετε, φάγετε·
ἀνάσταντες οἱ ἄρχοντες ἑτοιμάσατε θυρεούς, ὅτι οὕτως εἶπεν Κύριος πρὸς μέ Βαδίσας σεαυτῷ στῆσον σκοπόν, καὶ ὃ ἐὰν ἴδῃς ἀνάγγειλον.
καὶ ἴδον ἀναβάτας ἱππεῖς δύο, ἀναβάτην ὄνου καὶ ἀναβάτην καμήλου.
ἀκρόασαι ἀκρόασιν πολλήν, καὶ κάλεσον Οὐρείαν εἷς τὴν σκοπιὰν Κυρίου.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἔστην διὸ.
παντὸς ἡμέρας, καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς παρεμβολῆς ἔστην ὅλην τὴν νύκτα, καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἔρχεται ἀναβάτης συνωρίδος.
καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν Πέπτωκεν Βαβυλών, καὶ πάντα τὸ.
ἀγάλματα αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ χειροποίητα αὐτῆς συνετρίβησαν εἷς τὴν γῆν.
ἀκούσατε οἱ καταλελιμμένοι καὶ ὀδυνώμενοι, ἀκούσατε ἃ ἤκουσα παρὰ Κυρίου σαβαώβ·
ὃ θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἀνήγγειλεν ἡμῖν.
Τὸ ὅραμα τῆς Ἰδουμαίας.
Πρὸς ἐμὲ καλεῖτε παρὰ τοῦ Σηείρ Φυλάξετε ἐπάλξεις.
φυλάσσω τὸ πρωὶ καὶ τὴν νύκτα·
ἐὰν ζητῇς ζήτει, καὶ παρ’ ἐμοὶ οἴκει, ἐν τῷ δρυμῷ ἑσπέρας κοιμηθήσῃ, ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ Δαιδάν, εἰς συνάντησιν ὕδωρ διψῶντι φέρετε, οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν χώρᾳ.
Θαιμάν, ἄρτοις συναντᾶτε τοῖς φεύγουσιν διὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν φευγόντων καὶ διὸ.
τὸ πλήθος τῶν πλανωμένων καὶ διὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῆς μαχαίρας καὶ διὸ, τὸ πλῆθος τῶν τοξευμάτων τῶν διατεταμένων καὶ διὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν πεπτωκότων ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ.
ὅτι οὕτως εἶπέν μοι Κύριος Ἔτι ἐνιαυτὸς ὡς ἐνιαυτὸς μισθωτοῦ, ἐκλείψει ἡ δόξα τῶν υἱῶν Κηδάρ, καὶ τὸ κατάλοιπον τῶν τοξευμάτων τῶν ἰσχυρῶν υἱῶν Κηδὰρ ἔσται ὀλίγον, διότι Κύριος ἐλάλησεν ὃ θεὸς Ἰσραήλ.
Τὸ ὅραμα τῆς φάραγγος Σιών.
Τί ἐγένετό σοι νυν, ὅτι ἀνέβητε πάντες εἷς δώματα μάταια;
ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ πόλις βοώντων, οἱ τραυματίαι σου οὗ τραυματίαι μαχαίρας, οὐδὲ οἶ νεκροί σου νεκροὶ πολέμου.
πάντες οἶ ἄρχοντές σου πεφεύγασιν, καὶ οἶ ἁλόντες σκληρῶς δεδεμένοι εἰσίν, καὶ οἱ ἰσχύοντες ἐν σοὶ πόρρω πεφεύγασιν.
διὰ τοῦτο εἶπα Ἄφετέ με, πικρῶς κλαύσομαι·
μὴ κατισχύσητε παρακαλεῖν με ἐπὶ τὸ σύντριμμα τῆς θυγατρὸς τοῦ γένους μου.
ὅτι ἡμέρα ταραχῆς καὶ ἀπωλείας καὶ καταπατήματος, καὶ πλάνησις παρὰ Κυρίου σαβαώθ·
έν φάραγγι Σιὼν πλανῶνται, ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου πλανῶνται ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρη.
οἱ δὲ Ἐλαμεῖται ἔλαβον φαρέτρας, ἀναβάται ἅνθρωποι ἐφ’ ἵπποις, καὶ συναγωγὴ παρατάξεως.
καὶ ἔσονται αἶ ἐκλεκταὶ φάραγγές σου, πλησθήσονται ἁρμάτων, οἶ δὲ ἱππεῖς ἐμφράξουσι τὰς πύλας σου, καὶ ἀνακαλύψουσιν τὰς πύλας Ἰούδα·
καὶ ἐμβλέψονται τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἷς τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς οἴκους Τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἀνακαλύψουσιν λύψουσιν τὰ κρυπτὰ τῶν οἴκων τῆς ἄκρας Δαυείδ.
καὶ εἴδοσαν ὅτι πλείους εἰσίν, καὶ ὅτι ἀπέστρεψαν τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς ἀρχαίας κολυμβήθρας εἷς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ὅτι καθείλοσαν τοὺς οἴκους Ἰερουσαλὴμ εἷς ὀχύρωμα τοῦ τείχους τῇ πόλει.
καὶ ἐποιήσατε ἑαυτοῖς ὕδωρ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν δύο τειχέων, ἐσώτερον τῆς κολυμβήθρας τῆς ἀρχαίας, καὶ οὐκ ἐνεβλέψατε εἷς τὸν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς ποιήσαντα αὐτήν, καὶ τὸν κτίσαντα αὐτὴν οὐκ εἴδετε.
καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Κύριος σαβαὼθ ἓν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ κλαυθμὸν καὶ κοπετὸν καὶ ξύρησιν καὶ ζῶσιν σάκκων, αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐποιήσαντο εὐφροσύνην καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα, σφάζοντες μόσχους καὶ θύοντες πρόβατα, ὥστε φαγεῖν κρέα καὶ πιεῖν οἶνον, λέγοντες Φάγωμεν καὶ πίωμεν, αὔριον γὰρ ἀποθνήσκομεν.
καὶ ἀνακεκαλυμμένα ταῦτά ἐστιν ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν Κυρίου σαβαώθ, ὅτι οὔκ ἀφεθήσεται ὑμῖν αὕτη ἦ ἁμαρτία ἕως ἂν ἀποθάνητε.
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος σαβαώθ Πορεύου εἷς τὸ παστοφόριον πρὸς Σόμναν τὸν ταμίαν καὶ εἰπὸν αὐτῷ Τί σὺ ὧδε, καὶ τί σοί ἐστιν ὧδε ὅτι ἐλατόμησας σεαυτῷ ὧδε μνημεῖον, καὶ ἐποίησας σεαυτῷ ἐν ὑψηλῷ μνημεῖον, καὶ ἔγραψας σεαυτῷ ἐν πέτρᾳ.
σκηνήν;
ἰδοὺ δὴ Κύριος σαβαὼθ ἐκβαλεῖ καὶ ἐκτρίψει ἄνδρα, καὶ ἀφελεῖ τὴν στολήν σου καὶ τὸν στέφανόν σου τὸν ἔνδοξον, καὶ ῥίψει σε εἰς χώραν μεγάλην καὶ ἀμέτρητον, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀποθανῇ·
καὶ θήσει τὸ ἅρμα σου τὸ καλὸν εἰς ἀτιμίαν, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ἄρχοντός σου εἷς καταπάτημα, καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσει ἐκ τῆς οἰκονομίας σου καὶ ἐκ τῆς στάσεως σου.
καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καλέσω τὸν παῖδά μου Ἐλιακεὶμ τὸν τοῦ Χελκίου, καὶ ἐνδύσω αὐτὸν τὴν στολήν σου, καὶ τὸν στέφανόν σου δώσω αὐτῷ καὶ τὸ κράτος, καὶ τὴν οἰκονομίαν σου δώσω εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἔσται ὡς πατὴρ τοῖς ἐνοικοῦσιν ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ.
<καὶ τοῖς ἐνοικοῦσιν ἐν Ἰούδᾳ>.
καὶ δώσω τὴν δόξανΔαυεὶδ αὐτῷ, καὶ ἄρξει, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἀντιλέγων, καὶ δώσω τὴν κλεῖδα οἴκου Δαυεὶδ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὤμου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνοίξει καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἀποκλείσων, καὶ κλείσει καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἀνοίγων.
καὶ στήσω αὐτὸν ἄρχοντα ἐν τόπῳ πιστῷ, καὶ ἔσται εἰς θρόνον δόξης τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ.
καὶ ἔσται πεποιθὼς ἐπ’ αὐτὸν πᾶς ἔνδοξος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου, καὶ ἔσονται ἐπικρεμάμενοι ἐν αὐτῷ, πέν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ.
ἐκείνῃ.
τάδε λέγει Κύριος σαβαώθ·
κινηθήσεται ὁ ἅνθρωπος ὁ ἐστηριγμένος ἐν τόπῳ πιστῷ, καὶ πεσεῖται καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται ἡ δόξα ἡ ἐπ’ αὐτόν, ὅτι Κύριος ἐλάλησεν.
Τὸ ὅραμα Τύρου.
Ὀλολύζετε, πλοῖα Καρχηδόνος, ὅτι ἀπώλετο, καὶ οὐκέτι ἔρχονται ἐκ γῆς Κητιαίων·
ἦκται αἰχμάλωτος.
τίνι ὅμοιοι γεγόνασιν οἷ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ νήσῳ, μεταβόλοι Φοινίκης, διεκπερῶντες τὴν θάλασσαν ἐν ὕδατι πολλῷ, σπέρμα μεταβόλων;
ὡς εἰσφερομένου οἱ μεταβάλοι τῶν ἐθνῶν.
αἰσχύνθητι, Σιδών, εἶπεν ἡ θάλασσα·
ἡ δὲ ἰσχὺς τῆς θαλάσσης εἶπεν Οὐκ ὤδινον, οὐδὲ ἔτεκον, οὐδὲ ἐξέθρεψα νεανίσκους, οὐδὲ ὕψωσα παρθένους.
ὅταν δὲ ἀκουστὸν γένηται ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, λήμψεται αὐτοὺς ὀδύνη περὶ Τύρου.
ἀπέλθατε εἰς Καρχηδόνα, ὀλολύζετε, οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ταύτῃ.
οὐχ αὕτη ὑμῶν ἦν ἡ ὕβρις ἡ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς, πρὶν ἢ παραδοθῆναι αὐτήν;
τίς ταῦτα ἐβούλευσεν ἐπὶ Τύρον;
μὴ ἥσσων ἐστίν, ἦ οὐκ ἰσχύει;
οἱ ἔμποροι αὐτῆς ἔνδοξοι, ἄρχοντες τῆς γῆς.
Κύριος σαβαὼθ ἐβουλεύσατο παραλῦσαι τὴν ὕβριν τῶν ἐνδόξων καὶ ἀτιμάσω πᾶν ἔνδοξον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
ἐργάζου τὴν γῆν σου, καὶ γὰρ πλοῖα οὐκέτι ἔρχονται ἐκ Καρχηδόνος.
ἡ δὲ χείρ σου οὐκέτι ἰσχύει κατὰ θάλασσαν, ἡ παροξύνουσα βασιλεῖς·
Κύριος σαβαὼθ ἐνετείλατο περὶ Χανάαν ἀπολέσω αὐτῆς τὴν ἰσχύν.
καὶ ἐροῦσιν Οὐκέτι μὴ προσθῆτε τοῦ ὑβρίζειν καὶ ἀδικεῖν τὴν θυγατέρα Σιών·
καὶ ἐὰν ἀπέλθῃς εἷς Κητιείμ, οὐδὲ ἐκεῖ σοι ἀνάπαυσις ἔσται·
καὶ εἷς γῆν Χαλδαίων, ἢ καὶ αὕτη ἠρήμωται ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων, οὐδὲ ἐκεῖ σοι ἀνάπαυσις ἔσται, ὅτι ὁ τοῖχος αὐτῆς πέπτωκεν.
ὀλολύζετε, πλοῖα Καρχηδόνος, ὅτι ἀπώλετο τὸ ὀχύρωμα ὑμῶν.
καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καταλειφθήσεται Τύρος ἔτη ἑβδομήκοντα, ὡς χρόνος βασιλέως, ὡς χρόνος ἀνθρώπου·
καὶ ἔσται μετὰ ἑβδομήκοντα <ἔτη> ἔσται Τύρος ὡς ᾆσμα πόρνης.
λάβε κιθάραν, ῥέμβευσον, πόλις πόρνη ἐπιλελησμένη, καλῶς κιθάρισον, πολλὰ ᾆσον, ἵνα σου ἡ μνεία γένηται.
καὶ ἔσται μετὰ ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτη ἐπισκοπὴν ποιήσει ὃ θεὸς Τύρου, καὶ πάλιν ἀποκαταστήσεται εἷς τὸ ἀρχαῖον, καὶ ἔσται ἐμπόριον πάσαις ταῖς βασιλείαις τῆς οἰκουμένης.
καὶ ἔσται αὐτῆς ἡ ἐμπορία καὶ ὅ μισθὸς ἅγιον τῷ Κυρίῳ, οὒκ αὐτοῖς συναχθήσεται ἀλλὰ τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν ἔναντι Κυρίου, πᾶσα ἡ ἐμπορία αὐτῆς, φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν καὶ ἐμπλησθῆναι, εἰς συμβολὴν μνημόσυνον <ἔναντι Κυρίου> Ἰδοὺ Κύριος καταφθείρει τὴν οἰκουμένην, καὶ ἐρημώσει αὐτήν, καὶ ἀνακαλύψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς, καὶ διασπερεῖ τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας ἐν αὐτῃ.
καὶ ἔσται ὁ καὶ ἔσται ὁ λαὸς ὡς ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ ὃ παῖς ὡς ὃ κύριος, καὶ ἡ θεράπαινα ὡς ἡ κυρία·
ἔσται ὃ ἀγοράζων ὦς ὃ πωλῶν, καὶ ὅ δανίζων ὡς ὃ δανιζόμενος, καὶ ὃ ὀφείλων ὡς ᾧ ὀφίλει.
φθορᾷ φθαρήσεται ἡ γῆ, καὶ προνομῇ προνομευθήσεται ἦ τὸ γὰρ στόμα Κυρίου ἐλάλησεν ταῦτα.
ἐπένθησεν ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἐφθάρη ἡ οἰκουμένη, καὶ ἐπένθησαν οἱ ὑψηλοὶ τῆς γῆς.
ἡ δὲ γῆ ἠνόμησεν διὸ, τοὺς κατοικοῦντας αὐτήν, διότι παρέβησαν τὸν νόμον καὶ ἤλλαξαν τὰ προστάγματα Κυρίου, διαθήκην αἰώνιον.
διὰ τοῦτο ἀρὰ, ἔ ἔδεται τὴν γῆν, ὅτι ἡμάρτοσαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες αὐτήν·
διὰ τοῦτο πτωχοὶ ἔσονται οἶ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ καταλειφθήσονται ἅνθρωποι ὀλίγοι.
πενθήσει οἶνος, πενθήσει ἄμπελος, στενάξουσιν πάντες οἱ εὐφραινόμενοι τὴν ψυχήν.
πέπαυται εὐφροσύνη τυμπάνων, πέπαυται αὐθαδία καὶ πλοῦτος ἀσεβῶν, πέπαυται φωνὴ κιθάρας.
ᾐσχύνθησαν, οὐκ ἔπιον οἶνον, πικρὸν ἐγένετο τὸ σίκερα τοῖς πίνουσιν.
ἠρμώθη πᾶσα πόλις, κλείσει οἰκίαν τοῦ μὴ εἰσελθεῖν.
ὀλολύζετε περὶ τοῦ οἴνου πανταχῇ·
πέπαυται πᾶσα τῆς γῆς.
καὶ καταλειφθήσονται πόλεις ἔρημοι, καὶ οἶκοι ἐγκαταλελιμμένοι ἀπολοῦνται.
ταῦτα πάντα ἔστω ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἐθνῶν·
ὃν τρόπον ἐάν τις καλαμήσηται ἐλαίαν, οὕτως καλαμήσονται αὐτούς·
καὶ ἐὰν παύσηται ὁ τρυγητός.
οὗτοι φωνῇ βοήσονται, οἱ δὲ καταλειφθέντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς εὐφρανθήσονται ἅμα τῇ δόξῃ Κυρίου, ταραχθήσεται τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς θαλάσσης.
διὰ τοῦτο ἦ δόξα Κυρίου ἐν ταῖς νήσοις ἔσται τῆς θαλάσσης, τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου ἔνδοξον ἔσται.
Κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ἀπὸ τῶν πτερύγων τῆς γῆς τέρατα ἠκούσαμεν, Ἐλπὶς τῷ εὐσεβεῖ.
καὶ ἐροῦσιν Οὐαὶ τοῖς ἀθετοῦσιν·
οἶ ἀθετοῦντες τὸν νόμον, φόβος καὶ βόθυνος καὶ παγὶς ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
καὶ ἔσται ὃ φεύγων τὸν φόβον ἐμπεσεῖται εἷς τὸν βόθυνον·
ὁ δὲ ἐκβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ βοθύνου ἁλώσεται ὑπὸ τῆς παγίδος·
ὅτι θυρίδες ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἠνεῴχθησαν, καὶ σεισθήσεται τὰ θεμέλια τῆς γῆς.
ταραχῇ ταραχθήσεται ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἀπορίᾳ ἀπορηθήσεται ἡ γῆ.
ἔκλινεν καὶ σεισθήσεται ὡς ὀπωροφυλάκιον ἦ γῆ, ὡς ὃ μεθύων καὶ ὃ κραιπαλῶν, καὶ πεσεῖται, καὶ οὗ μὴ δύνηται ἀναστῆναι·
κατίσχυσεν γὰρ ἐπ’ αὐτῆς ἡ ἀνομία.
Καὶ Καὶ ἐπάξει ὁ θεὸς ἐπὶ τὸν κόσμον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τὴν χεῖρα καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς.
καὶ συνάξουσιν καὶ ἀποκλείσουσιν εἷς ὀχύρωμα καὶ εἷς δεσμωτήριον·
διὰ πολλῶν γενεῶν ἐπισκοπὴ ἔσται αὐτῶν.
καὶ τακήσεται ἡ πλίνθος, καὶ πεσεῖται τὸ τεῖχος·
ὅτι βασιλεύσει Κύριος ἐν Σιὼν καὶ ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐναντίον τῶν πρεσβυτέρων δοξασθήσεται.
Ὠιδή.
Κύριε ὅ θεός μου, δοξάσω σε, ὑμνήσω τὸ ὄνομά σου, ὅτι ἐποιήσας θαυμαστὰ.
πράγματα, βουλὴν ἀρχαίαν ἀληθινήν·
γένοιτο, Κύριε.
ὅτι ἔθηκας πόλεις εἷς χῶμα, πολεῖς ὀχυρὰς τοῦ πεσεῖν αὐτῶν τὰ θεμέλια·
τῶν ἀσεβῶν πόλις τὸν αἰῶνα οὐ μὴ οἰκοδομηθῇ.
διὰ τοῦτο εὐλογήσει σε ὃ λαὸς ὃ πτωχός, καὶ πόλεις ἀνθρώπων ἀδικουμένων εὐλογήσουσίν σε.
ἐγένου γὰρ πάσῃ πόλει ταπεινῇ βοηθός, καὶ τοῖς ἀθυμήσασιν δι’ ἔνδειαν σκέπη, ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων πονηρῶν ῥύσῃ αὐτούς·
σκέπη διψώντων, καὶ πνεῦμα ἀνθρώπων ἀδικουμένων, εὐλογήσουσίν σε, ὡς ἅνθρωποι ὀλιγόψυχοι διψῶντες ἐν Σιὼν ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων ἀσεβῶν, οἷς ἡμᾶς παρέδωκας.
καὶ ποιήσει Κύριος σαβαὼθ πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν·
ἐπὶ τὸ ὅρος τοῦτο πίονται εὐφροσύνην, πίονται οἶνον·
χρίσονται μύρον ἐν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ.
παράδος ταῦτα πάντα τοῖς ἔθνεσιν·
ἡ γὰρ βουλὴ αὕτη ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη.
κατέπιεν ὅ θάνατος ἰσχύσας, καὶ πάλιν ἀφεῖλεν ὃ θεὸς πᾶν δάκρυον ἀπὸ παντὸς προσώπου·
τὸ ὄνειδος τοῦ λαοῦ ἀφεῖλεν ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς γῆς, τὸ γὰρ στόμα Κυρίου ἐλάλησεν.
καὶ ἐροῦσιν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ Ἰδοὺ ὃ θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐφ’ᾦ ἠλπίζομεν, καὶ ἠγαλλιώμεθα καὶ εὐφράνθημεν ἐπὶ τῇ σωτηρίᾳ.
ἡμῶν.
ὅτι ἀνάπαυσιν δώσει ὃ θεὸς ἐπὶ τὸ ὅρος τοῦτο, καὶ καταπατηθήσεται ἡ Μωαβῖτις ὃν τρόπον πατοῦσιν ἅλωνα ἐν ἁμάξαις·
καὶ ἀνήσει τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, ὃν τρόπον καὶ αὐτὸς ἐταπείνωσεν τοῦ ἀπολέσαι, καὶ ταπεινώσει τὴν ὕβριν αὐτοῦ ἐφ’ ἃ τὰς χεῖρας ἐπέβαλεν·
τὸ ὕψος τῆς καταφυγῆς τοῦ τοίχου σου ταπεινώσει, καὶ καταβήσεται ἕως τοῦ ἐδάφους.
Ὠιδή.
Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ᾄσονται τὸ ᾆσμα τοῦτο ἐπὶ γῆς Ἰούδα, λέγοντες Ἰδοὺ πόλις ὀχυρά, καὶ σωτήριον ἡμῖν θήσει τεῖχος καὶ περίτειχος.
ἀνοίξατε πύλας, εἰσελθάτω λαὸς φυλάσσων δικαιοσύνην καὶ φυλάσσων ἀλήθειαν, ἀντιλαμβανόμενος ἀληθείας καὶ φυλάσσων εἰρήνην.
ὅτι ἐπι σοὶ ἤλπισαν, Κύριε, ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος, ὁ θεὸς ὅ μέγας ὅ αἰώνιος, ὃς ταπεινώσας κατήγαγες τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας ἐν ὑψηλοῖς·
πόλεις ὀχυρὰς καταβαλεῖς, καὶ κατάξεις αὐτὰς ἕως τοῦ ἐδάφους, καὶ πατήσουσιν αὐτοὺς πόδες πραέων καὶ ταπεινῶν.
ὁδὸς εὐσεβῶν εὐθεῖα ἐγένετο, καὶ παρεσκευασμένη ἡ ὁδὸς τῶν εὐσεβῶν.
ἡ γὰρ ὁδὸς Κυρίου κρίσις·
ἠλπίσαμεν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί σου καὶ ἐπὶ ᾖ μνείᾳ ἡ ἐπιθυμεῖ ἦ( Ὠιδή.
) ἐκ νυκτὸς ὀρθρίζει τὸ πνεῦμά μου πρὸς σέ, ὅ θεός, διότι φῶς τὰ προστάγματά σου ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
δικαιοσύνην μάθετε, οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
πέπαυται γὰρ ὁ ἀσεβής·
οὐ μὴ μάθῃ δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἀλήθειαν οὔ μὴ ποιήσῃ·
ἀρθήτω ὃ ἀσεβής, ἶνα μὴ ἴδῃ τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου.
Κύριε, ὑψηλός σου ὅ βραχίων καὶ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν, γνόντες δὲ αἰσχυνθήσονται·
ζῆλος λήμψεται λαὸν ἀπαίδευτον, καὶ νῦν πῦρ τοὺς ὑπεναντίους ἔδεται.
Κύριε ὃ θεὸς ἡμῶν, εἰρήνην δὸς ἡμῖν, πάντα γὰρ ἀπέδωκας Κύριε ὃ θεὸς ἡμῶν, κτῆσαι Κύριε, ἐκτὸς σοῦ ἄλλον οὐκ οἴδαμεν, τὸ ὄνομά σου ὀνομάζομεν.
οἱ δὲ νεκροὶ ζωὴν οὔ μὴ ἴδωσιν, οὐδὲ ἰατροὶ οὗ μὴ ἀναστήσουσιν·
διὰ τοῦτο ἐπήγαγες καὶ ἀπώλεσας καὶ ἦρας πᾶν ἅρσεν αὐτῶν.
πρόσθες αὐτοῖς κακά, Κύριε, πρόσθες κακὰ πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐνδόξοις τῆς γῆς.
Κύριε, ἐν θλίψει ἐμνήσθην σου, ἐν θλίψει μικρᾷ ἡ παιδία σου ἡμῖν.
καὶ ὡς ἦ ὠδίνουσα ἐγγίζει τοῦ τεκεῖν, καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ ὠδῖνι αὐτῆς ἐκέκραξεν, οὕτως ἐγενήθημεν τῷ ἀγαπητῷ σου.
διὰ τὸν φόβον σου, Κύριε, ἐν γαστρὶ ἐλάβομεν καὶ ὠδινήσαμεν καὶ ἐτέκομεν·
πνεῦμα σωτηρίας σου ἐποιήσαμεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἀλλὰ πεσοῦνται οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
ἀναστήσονται γὰρ οἱ νεκροί, καὶ ἐγερθήσονται οἷ ἐν τοῖς μνημείοις, καὶ εὐφρανθήσονται οἱ ἐν τῇ γῇ·
ἡ γὰρ δρόσος ἡ παρὰ σοῦ ἴαμα αὐτοῖς ἐστιν, ἡ δὲ γῆ τῶν ἀσεβῶν πεσεῖται.
Βάδιζε, ὁ λαός μου, εἴσελθε εἷς τὰ ταμιεῖά σου, ἀπόκλεισον τὴν θύραν σου, ἀποκρύβηθι μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον, ἕως ἂν παρέλθῃ ἡ ὀργὴ Κυρίου.
ἰδοὺ γὰρ Κύριος ἀπὸ τοῦ ἁγίου ἐπάγει τὴν ὀργὴν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς·
καὶ ἀνακαλύψει ἡ γῆ τὸ <αἷμα> αὐτῆς, καὶ οὗ κατακαλύψει ἡ γῆ τοὺς Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐπάξει ὃ θεὸς τὴν μάχαιραν τὴν ἁγίαν καὶ τὴν μεγάλην καὶ τὴν ἰσχυρὰν ἐπὶ τὸν δράκοντα ὄφιν φεύγοντα, ἐπὶ τὸν δράκοντα ὄφιν σκολιόν, καὶ ἀνελεῖ τὸν δράκοντα.
Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀμπελὼν καλός·
ἐπιθύμημα ἐξάρχειν κατ’ αὐτῆς.
ἐγὼ πόλις ἰσχυρά, πόλις πολιορκουμένη, μάτην ποτιῶ αὐτήν·
ἁλώσεται γὰρ νυκτός, ἡμέρας δὲ πεσεῖται τὸ τεῖχος.
καὶ οὒκ ἔστιν ἧ οὐκ ἐπελάβετο αὐτῆς·
τίς με θήσει φυλάσσειν καλάμην ἐν ἀγρῷ, διὰ τὴν πολεμίαν ταύτην ἠθέτηκα αὐτήν.
τοίνυν διὰ τοῦτο ἐποίησεν Κύριος ὃ θεὸς πάντα ὅσα συνέταξεν.
κατακέκαυμαι, βοήσονται οἶ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ, ποιήσωμεν εἰρήνην αὐτῷ, ποιήσωμεν εἰρήνην.
οἱ ἐρχόμενοι, τέκνα Ἰακώβ, βλαστήσει καὶ ἐξανθήσει Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐμπλησθήσεται ἦ οἰκουμένη τοῦ καρποῦ αὐτοῦ.
μὴ ὡς αὐτὸς ἐπάταξεν, καὶ αὐτὸς οὕτως πληγήσεται;
καὶ ὡς αὐτὸς ἀνεῖλεν, οὕτως ἀναιρεθήσεται;
μαχόμενος καὶ ὀνειδίζων ἐξαποστελεῖ αὐτούς·
οὗ σὺ ἦσθα ὃ μελετῶν τῷ πνεύματι τῷ σκληρῷ, ἀνελεῖν αὐτοὺς πνεύματι θυμοῦ;
διὰ τοῦτο ἀφαιρεθήσεται ἡ ἀνομία Ἰακώβ, καὶ τοῦτό ἐστιν ἡ εὐλογία αὐτοῦ, ὅταν ἀφέλωμαι αὑτοῦ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν, ὅταν θῶ πάντας τοὺς λίθους τῶν βωμῶν κατακεκομμένους ὡς κονίαν λεπτήν·
καὶ οὐ μὴ μείνῃ τὸ.
δένδρα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ εἴδωλα αὐτῶν ἐκκεκομμένα ὥσπερ δρυμὸς μακράν.
τὸ κατοικούμενον ποίμνιον ἀνειμένον ἔσται, ὡς ποίμνιον καταλελιμμένον·
καὶ ἔσται πολὺν χρόνον εἷς βόσκημα, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀναπαύσονται.
μετὰ χρόνον οὐκ ἔσται ἐν αὐτῇ πᾶν χλωρὸν διὸ.
τὸ ξηρανθῆναι.
γυναῖκες ἐρχόμεναι ἀπὸ θέας, δεῦτε·
οὔ γὰρ λαός ἐστιν ἔχων σύνεσιν, διὸ.
τοῦτο οὐ μὴ οἰκτειρήσῃ ὅ ποιήσας αὐτούς, οὐδὲ ὁ πλάσας αὐτοὺς οὔ μὴ ἐλεήσει.
Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ συμφράξει Κύριος ἀπὸ τῆς διώρυγος τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἕως ῾Ρινοκορούρων·
ὑμεῖς δὲ συναγάγετε τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ κατ’ ἕνα ἕνα.
Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ σαλπιοῦσιν ἓν τῇ σάλπιγγι τῇ μεγαλῇ, καὶ ἥξουσιν οἶ <ἀπολόμενοι> ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων καὶ οἶ ἀπολόμενοι ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ προσκυνήσουσιν τῷ κυρίῳ ἐπὶ τὸ ὅρος τὸ ἅγιον ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ.
Οὐαὶ τῷ στεφάνῳ τῆς ὕβρεως, οἱ μισθωτοὶ Ἐφραίιμ, τὸ ἄνθος τὸ ἐκπεσὸν ἐκ τῆς δόξης ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ παχέως, οἶ μεθύοντες ἄνευ οἴνου.
ἰδοὺ ἰσχυρὸν καὶ σκληρὸν ὃ θυμὸς Κυρίου, ὣς χάλαζα καταφερομένη οὐκ ἔχουσα σκέπην, καταφερομένη·
ὡς ὕδατος πολὺ πλῆθος σῦρον χώραν, τῇ γῇ ποιήσει ἀνάπαυσιν·
ταῖς χερσίν, καὶ τοῖς ποσὶν καταπατη- θήσεται ὃ στέφανος τῆς ὕβρεως, οἱ μισθωτοὶ τοῦ Ἐφράιμ.
καὶ ἔσται τὸ ἄνθος τὸ ἐκπεσὸν τῆς ἐλπίδος τῆς δόξης ἐπ’ ἄκρου τοῦ ὅρους Καὶ τοῦ ὑψηλοῦ·
ὡς πρόδρομος σύκου, ὃ ἰδὼν αὐτό, πρὶν ἢ εἷς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ λαβεῖν, θελήσει αὐτὸ καταπιεῖν.
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται Κύριος σαβαὼθ ὃ στέφανος τῆς ἐλπίδος ὁ πλακεὶς τῆς δόξης, τῷ καταλειφθέντι μου λαῷ καὶ καταλειφθήσονται ἐπὶ πνεύματι κρίσεως οὗτοι γὰρ οἴνῳ πεπλανημένοι ἐπὶ κρίσιν καὶ ἰσχὺν κωλύων ἀνελεῖν.
οὗτοι γάρ οἴνῳ πεπλανημένοι εἰσίν·
ἐπλανήθησαν διὰ τὸ σίκερα, ἱερεὺς καὶ προφήτης ἐξέστησαν διὰ τὸν οἶνον, ἐσείσθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς μέθης τοῦ σίκερα, ἐπλανήθησαν·
τοῦτό ἐστιν φάντασμα.
ἀρὰ ἔδεται ταύτην τὴν βουλήν·
αὕτη ἡ βουλὴ ἕνεκεν πλεονεξίας.
τίνι ἀνηγγείλαμεν κακά, καὶ τίνι ἀνηγγείλαμεν ἀγγελίαν;
οἱ ἀπογεγαλακτισμένοι ἀπὸ γάλακτος, οἱ ἀπεσπασμένοι ἀπὸ μαστοῦ.
θλίψιν ἐπὶ θλίψιν προσδέχου, ἐλπίδα ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι, ἔτι μικρὸν ἔτι μικρόν, διὰ φαυλισμὸν χειλέων, διὸ.
γλώσσης ἑτέρας·
ὅτι λαλήσουσιν τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, λέγοντες αὐτῷ Τοῦτο τὸ ἀνάπαυμα τῷ πεινῶντι καὶ τοῦτο τὸ σύντριμμα, καὶ οὔκ ἠθέλησαν ἀκούειν.
καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς τὸ λόγιον Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ θλίψις ἐπὶ θλίψιν, ἐλπὶς ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι, ἔτι μικρὸν ἔτι μικρόν, ἵνα πορευθῶσιν καὶ πέσωσιν εἷς τὰ.
ὀπίσω, καὶ κινδυνεύσουσι καὶ συντριβήσονται καὶ ἁλώσονται.
Διὰ τοῦτο ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου, ἄνδρες τεθλιμμένοι καὶ ἄρχοντες τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ, ὅτι εἴπατε Ἐποιήσαμεν διαθήκην μετὰ.
τοῦ ᾅδου, καὶ μετὰ τοῦ θανάτου συνθήκας·
καταιγὶς φερομένη ἐὰν παρέλθῃ, οὗ μὴ ἔλθῃ ἡμῖν·
ἐθήκαμεν ψεῦδος τὴν ἐλπίδα ἡμῶν, καὶ τῷ ψεύδει σκεπασθησόμεθα.
θησόμεθα.
διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως λέγει Κύριος, Κύριος, ἐγὼ ἐμβαλῶ εἷς τὰ.
θεμέλια Σιὼν λίθον πολυτελῆ ἐκλεκτὸν ἀκρογωνιαῖον ἔντιμον, εἷς τὸ, θεμέλια αὐτῆς, καὶ ὃ πιστεύων ἐπ’ αὐτῷ οὔ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ.
καὶ θήσω κρίσιν εἷς ἐλπίδα, ἡ δὲ ἐλεημοσύνη μου εἷς σταθμούς, καὶ οἶ πεποιθότες μάτην ψεύδει·
ὅτι οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ ὑμᾶς καταιγίς, μὴ καὶ ἀφέλῃ ὑμῶν τὴν διαθήκην τοῦ θανάτου, καὶ ἡ ἐλπὶς ὑμῶν ἦ πρὸς τὸν ᾅδην οὗ μὴ ἐμμείνῃ·
καταιγὶς φερομένη ἐὰν ἐπέλθῃ, ἔσεσθε αὐτῇ εἷς καταπάτημα.
ὅταν παρέλθῃ, λήμψεται ὑμᾶς·
πρωὶ πρωὶ παρελεύσεται ἡμέρας, καὶ ἓν νυκτὶ ἔσται ἐλπὶς πονηρά.
μάθετε ἀκούειν στενοχωρούμενοι·
οὔ δυνάμεθα μάχεσθαι, αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀσθενοῦμεν τοῦ ἡμᾶς συναχθῆναι.
ὥσπερ ὅρος ἀσεβῶν ἀναστήσεται, καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ φάραγγι Γαβαών, μετὰ θυμοῦ ποιήσει τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, πικρίας ἔργον·
ὁ δὲ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ ἀλλοτρίως χρήσεται, καὶ ἡ πικρία αὐτοῦ ἀλλοτρία.
καὶ ὑμεῖς μὴ εὐφρανθείητε, μηδὲ ἰσχυσάτωσαν ὑμῶν οἶ δεσμοί·
διότι συντετελεσμένα καὶ συντετμημένα πράγματα ἥκουσα παρὰ.
Κυρίου σαβαὼθ ἅ ποιήσει ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν.
Ἐνωτίζεσθε καὶ ἀκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου, προσέχετε καὶ ἀκούετε τοὺς λόγους μου.
μὴ ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν μέλλει ὃ ἀροτριῶν ἀροτριᾶν;
ἦ σπόρον προετοιμάσει πρὶν ἐργάσασθαι τὴν γῆν;
καὶ ὅταν ὁμαλίσῃ αὐτῆς τὸ πρόσωπον, πρῶτον σπείρει μικρὸν μελάνθιον καὶ κύμινον, καὶ πάλιν πυρόν, καὶ κριθὴν καὶ ζέαν ἐν τοῖς ὁρίοις σου καὶ παιδευθήσῃ κρίματι θεοῦ σου, καὶ εὐφρανθήσῃ.
οὐ γὰρ μετὰ σκληρότητος καθαίρεται τὸ μελάνθιον, οὐδὲ τροχὸς ἀμάξης περιάξει ἐπὶ τὸ κύμινον·
ἀλλὰ.
ῥάβδῳ ἐκτινάσσεται τὸ μελάνθιον, τὸ δὲ κύμινον μετὰ ἄρτου βρωθήσεται.
οὗ γὰρ εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα ἐγὼ ὑμῖν ὀργισθήσομαι, οὐδὲ φωνὴ τῆς πικρίας μου καταπατήσει ὑμᾶς.
καὶ ταῦτα παρὰ Κυρίου σαβαὼθ ἐξῆλθεν τὰ τέρατα·
βουλεύσασθε, ὑψώσατε ματαίαν παράκλησιν.
Οὐαὶ πόλις Ἀριήλ, ἢν Δαυεὶδ ἐπολέμησεν·
συναγάγετε γενήματα ἐνιαυτὸν ἐπ’ ἐνιαυτόν·
φάγεσθε γὰρ σὺν Μωάβ ἐκθλίψω γὰρ Ἀριήλ, καὶ ἔσται αὐτῆς ἡ ἰσχὺς καὶ τὸ πλοῦτος ἐμοί.
καὶ κυκλώσω ὡς Δαυεὶδ ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ βαλῶ περὶσὲ χάρακα, καὶ θήσω ἐπὶ σὲ πύργους, καὶ ταπεινωθήσονται οἱ λόγοι σου εἷς τὴν γῆν, καὶ εἷς τὴν γῆν οἱ λόγοι σου δύσονται·
καὶ ἔσται ὡς οἱ φωνοῦντες ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἡ φωνή σου, καὶ πρὸς τὸ ἔδαφος ἡ φωνή σου ἀσθενήσει.
καὶ ἔσται ὡς κονιορτὸς ἀπὸ τροχοῦ ὃ πλοῦτος τῶν ἀσεβῶν, καὶ ὡς χνοῦς φερόμενος, καὶ ἔσται ὡς στιγμὴ παραχρῆμα παρὰ Κυρίου σαβαώθ·
ἐπισκοπὴ γὰρ ἔσται μετὰ, κραυγῆς καὶ σεισμοῦ καὶ φωνῆς μεγάλης, καταιγὶς φερομένη καὶ φλὸξ πυρὸς κατεσθίουσα.
καὶ ἔσται ὡς ὃ ἐνυπνιαζόμενος ἐνύπνιον ὃ πλοῦτος τῶν ἐθνῶν πάντων ὅσοι ἐπεστράτευσαν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ πάντες οἱ στρατευσάμενοι ἐπὶ Ἰερουσαλήμ, καὶ πάντες οἱ συνηγμένοι ἐπ’ αὐτὴν καὶ θλίβοντες αὐτήν.
καὶ ἔσονται ὡς οἶ ἐν ὕπνῳ πεινῶντες καὶ ἔσθοντες, καὶ ἐξαναστάντων μάταιον αὐτῶν τὸ ἐνύπνιον·
καὶ ὃν τρόπον ἐνυπνιάζεται ὁ διψῶν ὡς ὁ πίνων, καὶ ἐξαναστὰς ἔτι διψᾷ, ἡ δὲ αὐτοῦ εἷς κενὸν ἤλπισεν, οὕτως ἔσται ὃ πλοῦτος πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν ὅσοι ἐπεστράτευσαν ἐπὶ Ἰερουσαλὴμ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ὅρος Σιών.
Ἐκλύθητε καὶ ἔκστητε, καὶ κραιπαλήσατε οὐκ ἀπὸ σίκερα οὐδ’ ἀπὸ οἴνου·
ὅτι πεπότικεν ὑμᾶς Κύριος πνεύματι κατανύξεως, καὶ καμμύσει τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν προφητῶν αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτῶν, οἱ ὁρῶντες τὰ κρυπτά.
καὶ ἔσονται ὑμῖν πάντα τὸ.
ῥήματα ταῦτα ὡς οἶ λόγοι τοῦ βιβλίου τοῦ ἐσφραγισμένου τούτου, ὃ ἐὰν δῶσιν αὐτὸ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐπισταμένῳ γράμματα λέγοντες Ανάγνωθι ταῦτα, καὶ ἐρεῖ Οὐ δύναμαι ἀναγνῶναι, ἐσφράγισται γάρ.
καὶ δοθήσεται τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο εἷς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπου μὴ ἐπισταμένου γράμματα, καὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ Ἀνάγνωθ(??) τοῦτο·
καὶ ἐρεῖ Οὐκ ἐπίσταμαι γράμματα.
καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος Ἐγγίζει μοι ὃ λαὸς οὗτος, τοῖς χείλεσιν αὐτῶν τιμῶσιν με, ἡ δὲ καρδία αὐτῶν πόρρω ἀπέχει ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ·
μάτην δὲ σέβονταί με διδάσκοντες ἐντάλματα ἀνθρώπων καὶ διδασκαλίας.
διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ προσθήσω τοῦ μεταθεῖναι τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον·
καὶ μεταθήσω αὐτούς, καὶ ἀπολῶ τὴν σοφίαν τῶν σοφῶν, καὶ τὴν σύνεσιν τῶν συνετῶν κρύψω.
Οὐαὶ οἶ βαθέως βουλὴν ποιοῦντες, καὶ οὔ διὰ Κυρίου·
οὐαὶ οἶ ἐν κρυφῇ βουλὴν ποιοῦντες, καὶ ἔσται ἐν σκότει τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐροῦσιν Τίς ἡμᾶς ἑώρακεν;
καὶ τίς ἡμᾶς γνώσεται ἢ ἅ ἡμεῖς ποιοῦμεν;
οὐχ ὡς ὃ πηλὸς τοῦ κεραμέως λογισθήσεσθε;
μὴ ἐρεῖ τὸ πλάσμα τῷ πλάσαντι Οὐ σύ με ἔπλασας;
ἦ τὸ ποίημα τῷ ποιήσαντι Οὐ συνετῶς με ἐποίησας;
οὐκέτι μικρὸν καὶ μετατεθήσεται ὅ Λίβανος ὧς τὸ ὅρος τὸ Χερμέλ, καὶ τὸ ὅρος τὸ Χερμὲλ εἰς δρυμὸν λογισθήσεται.
καὶ ἀκούσονται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ κωφοὶ λόγους βιβλίου, καὶ οἱ ἐν τῷ σκότει καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ ὁμίχλῃ, ὀφθαλμοὶ τυφλῶν βλέψονται, καὶ ἀγαλλιάσονται πτωχοὶ διὰ Κύριον ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ, καὶ οἱ ἀπηλπισμένοι τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐμπλησθήσονται εὐφροσύνης.
ἐξέλιπεν ἄνομος, καὶ ἀπώλετο ὑπερήφανος, καὶ ἐξωλεθρεύθησαν οἱ ἀνομοῦντες ἐπὶ κακία, καὶ οἱ ποιοῦντες ἁμαρτεῖν ἀνθρώπους ἐν λόγῳ·
πάντας δὲ τοὺς ἐλέγχοντας ἐν πύλαις πρόσκομμα θήσουσιν, καὶ ἐπλαγίασαν ἐν ἀδίκοις δίκαιον.
διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰακώβ, ὃν ἀφώρισεν ἐξ Ἀβραάμ Οὐ νῦν αἰσχυνθήσεται Ἰακώβ, οὐδὲ νῦν τὸ πρόσωπον μεταβαλεῖ Ἰσραήλ.
ἀλλὰ ὅταν ἴδωσιν τὸ.
τέκνα αὐτῶν τὸ.
ἔργα μου, δι’ ἐμὲ ἁγιάσουσιν τὸ ὄνομά.
μου, καὶ ἁγιάσουσιν τὸν ἅγιον Ἰακώβ, καὶ τὸν θεὸν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ φοβηθήσονται.
.
καὶ γνώσονται οἶ τῷ πνεύματι πλανώμενοι σύνεσιν, οἱ δὲ γογγύζοντες μαθήσονται ὑπακούειν, καὶ αἶ γλῶσσαι αἱ ψελλίζουσαι μαθήσονται λαλεῖν·
εἰρήνην.
ὐαὶ τέκνα ἀποστάται, τάδε λέγει Κύριος·
ἐποιήσατε βουλὴν καὶ οὐ δι’ ἐμοῦ, καὶ συνθήκας οὐ διὰ τοῦ πνεύματός μου, προσθεῖναι ἁμαρτίας ἐφ’ ἁμαρτίαις·
οἱ πορευόμενοι καταβῆναι εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ἐμὲ δὲ οὐκ ἐπηρώτησαν, τοῦ βοηθηθῆναι ὑπὸ Φαραὼ καὶ σκεπασθῆναι ὑπὸ Αἰγυπτίων.
ἔσται γὰρ ὑμῖν ἡ σκέπη Φαραὼ εἷς αἰσχύνην, καὶ τοῖς πεποιθόσιν ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον ὄνειδος.
ὅτι εἰσὶν ἐν Τάνει ἀρχηγοὶ ἄγγελοι πονηροί·
μάτην κοπιάσουσιν πρὸς λαὸν ὃς οὐκ ὠφελήσει αὐτοὺς οὔτε εἰς βοήθειαν οὔτε εἷς ὠφέλειαν, ἀλλὰ εἷς αἰσχύνην καὶ ὄνειδος.
Ἡ ὅρασις τῶν τετραπόδων τῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ.
Ἐν τῇ θλίψει καὶ ἐν τῇ στενοχωρίᾳ λέων καὶ σκύμνος λέοντος, ἐκεῖθεν καὶ ἀσπίδες καὶ ἔκγονα ἀσπίδων πετομένων, οἳ ἔφερον ἐπ’ ὄνων καὶ καμήλων τὸν πλοῦτον αὐτῶν πρὸς.
ἔθνος ὃ οὐκ ὠφελήσει αὐτοὺς εἷς βοήθειαν ἀλλὰ εἰς αἰσχύνην καὶ ὄνειδος].
Αἰγύπτιοi μάταια καὶ κενὰ ὠφελήσουσιν ὑμᾶς·
ἀπάγγειλον αὐτοῖς ὅτι ματαία ἡ παράκλησις ὑμῶν αὕτη.
νῦν οὖν καθίσας γράψον ἐπὶ πυξίου ταῦτα καὶ εἷς βιβλίον, ὅτι ἔσται εἷς ἡμέρας καιρῶν ταῦτα καὶ εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα.
ὅτι λαὸς ἀπειθής ἐστιν, υἱοὶ ψευδεῖς οἳ οὐκ ἠβούλοντο ἀκούειν τὸν νόμον τοῦ θεοῦ, οἱ λέγοντες τοῖς προφήταις Μὴ ἀναγγέλλετε ἡμῖν, καὶ τοῖς τὸ.
ὁράματα ὁρῶσιν Μὴ λαλεῖτε ἡμῖν, ἀλλὰ ἡμῖν λαλεῖτε καὶ ἀναγγέλλετε ἡμῖν ἑτέραν πλάνησιν, καὶ ἀποστρέψατε ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ ταύτης·
ἀφέλετε ἀφ’ ἡμῶν τὸν τρίβον τοῦτον, καὶ ἀφέλετε ἀφ’ ἡμῶν τὸ λόγιον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὃ ἅγιος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ Ὅτι ἠπειθήσατε τοῖς λόγοις τούτοις καὶ ἠλπίσατε ἐπὶ ψεύδει, καὶ ὅτι ἐγόγγυσας καὶ πεποιθὼς ἐγένου ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ, διὰ.
τοῦτο ἔσται ὑμῖν ἡ ἁμαρτία αὕτη ὡς τεῖχος πίπτον παραχρῆμα πόλεως ἑαλωκυίας, ἧς παραχρῆμα πάρεστιν τὸ πτῶμα·
καὶ τὸ πτῶμα αὐτῆς ἔσται ὡς σύντριμμα ἀγγίου ὀστρακίνου, ἐκ κεραμίου λεπτόν, ὥστε μὴ εὑρεῖν ἐν αὐτοῖς ὄστρακον ἐν ᾧ πῦρ ἀρεῖς, καὶ ἐνᾦ ἀποσυρεῖς ὕδωρ μικρόν.
οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὃ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ Ὅταν ἀποστραφεὶς στενάξῃς, τότε σωθήσῃ καὶ γνώσῃ ποῦ ἦσθα·
ὅτε ἐπεποίθεις ἐπὶ τοῖς ματαίοις, ματαία ἡ ἰσχὺς ὑμῶν ἐγενήθη.
καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλεσθε ἀκούειν, ἀλλὰ εἴπατε Ἐφ’ ἵπποις φευξόμεθα·
διὰ τοῦτο φεύξεσθε·
καὶ εἴπατε Ἐπὶ κούφοις ἀναβάται ἐσόμεθα·
διὸ, τοῦτο κοῦφοι ἔσονται οἱ διώκοντες ὑμᾶς.
καὶ διὰ φωνὴν ἐνὸς φεύξονται χίλιοι, καὶ διὰ φωνὴν πέντε φεύξονται πολλοί, ἕως ἄν καταλειφθῆτε ὡς ἱστὸς ἐπ’ ὅρους, καὶ ὡς σημαίαν φέρων ἐπὶ βουνοῦ.
καὶ πάλιν μενεῖ ὃ θεὸς τοῦ οἱκτεικριτὴς ρῆσαι ὑμᾶς, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ὑψωθήσεται τοῦ ἐλεῆσαι ὑμᾶς, διότι Κύριος ὃ θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐστιν·
καὶ ποῦ καταλείψετε τὴν δόξαν ὑμῶν;
μακάριοι πάντες οἱ ἐμμένοντες ἐν αὐτῷ.
Διότι λαὸς ἅγιος ἐν Σιὼν οἰκήσει·
καὶ Ἰερουσαλὴμ κλαυθμῷ ἔκλαυσεν Ἐλέησόν με·
καὶ ἐλεήσει τὴν φωνὴν τῆς κραυγῆς σου·
ἡνίκα εἶδεν, ἐπήκουσέν σου.
καὶ δώσει Κύριος ὑμῖν ἄρτον θλίψεως καὶ ὕδωρ στενόν, καὶ οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ ἐγγίσωσίν σοι οἱ πλανῶντές σε·
ὅτι οἶ ὀφθαλμοί σου ὄψονται τοὺς πλανῶντάς σε, καὶ τὰ ὦτά σου ἀκούσονται τοὺς λόγους τῶν ὀπίσω σε πλανησάντων, οἱ λήγοντες Αὕτη ἡ ὁδός, πορευθῶμεν ἐν αὐτῇ εἴτε δεξιὰ εἴτε ἀριστερά.
καὶ ἐξαρεῖς τὰ εἴδωλα τὸ.
περιηργυρωμένα καὶ τὰ περικεχρυσωμένα, λεπτὰ ποιήσεις, καὶ λικμήσεις ὡς ὕδωρ ἀποκαθημένης, καὶ ὡς κόπρον ὤσεις αὐτά.
τότε ἔσται ὃ ὑετὸς τῷ σπέρματι τῆς γῆς σου, καὶ ὁ ἄρτος τοῦ γενήματος τῆς γῆς σου ἔσται πλησμονὴ καὶ λιπαρός·
καὶ βοσκηθήσεταί σου τὸ.
κτήνη Τῆ ἡμέρᾳ.
ἐκείνῃ τόπον πίονα καὶ εὐρύχωρον, οἱ ταῦροι ὑμῶν καὶ οἶ βόες οἶ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν γῆν φάγονται ἄχυρα ἀναπεποιημένα ἐν κριθῇ λελικμημένα.
καὶ ἔσται ἐπὶ παντὸς ὄρους ὑψηλοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ παντὸς βουνοῦ μετεώρου ὕδωρ διαπορευόμενον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ.
ἐκείνῃ, ὅταν ἀπόλωνται πολλοί, καὶ ὅταν πέσωσιν πύργοι.
καί ἔσται τὸ φῶς τῆς σελήνης ὡς τὸ φῶς τοῦ ἡλίου, καὶ τὸ φῶς τοῦ ἡλίου ἔσται ἑπταπλάσιον, ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ὅταν ἰάσηται Κύριος τὸ σύντριμμα τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν ὀδύνην τῆς πληγῆς σου ἰάσεται.
Ἰδοὺ τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου διὰ, χρόνου ἔρχεται πολλοῦ, καιόμενος ὁ θυμός·
μετὰ δόξης τὸ λόγιον τῶν χειλέων αὐτοῦ, τὸ λόγιον ὀργῆς πλῆρες, καὶ ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ θυμοῦ ὡς πῦρ ἔδεται.
καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ ὡς ὕδωρ ἐν φάραγγι σῦρον ἥξει ἕως τοῦ τραχήλου, καὶ διαιρεθήσεται τοῦ ἔθνη ταράξαι ἐπὶ πλανήσει ματαίᾳ, καὶ διώξεται αὐτοὺς πλάνησις ματαία, καὶ λήμψεται αὐτοὺς κατὰ, πρόσωπον αὐτῶν.
μὴ διὰ.
παντὸς δεῖ ὑμᾶς εὐφραίνεσθαι, καὶ εἰσπορεύεσθαι εἰς τὰ ἅγιά μου διὰ, παντὸς ὡσεὶ ἑορτάζοντας, καὶ ὡσεὶ εὐφραινομένους εἰσελθεῖν μετὰ αὐλοῦ εἷς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Κυρίου πρὸς τόν θεὸν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ;
καὶ ἀκουστὴν ποιήσει ὁ θεὸς τὴν δόξαν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν θυμὸν τοῦ βραχίονος αὐτοῦ δεῖξαι μετὰ θυμοῦ καὶ ὀργῆς καὶ φλογὸς κατεσθιούσης, κεραυνώσει βιαίως, καὶ ὡς ὕδωρ καὶ χάλαζα συνκαταφερομένη βία.
διὰ γὰρ τὴν φωνὴν Κυρίου ἡττηθήσονται οἱ Ἀσσύριοι τῇ πληγῇ, ᾗ ἄν πατάξῃ αὐτούς.
καὶ ἔσται αὐτῷ κυκλόθεν, ὅθεν ἦν αὐτῷ ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς βοηθείας, ἐφ’ ᾗ αὐτὸς ἐπεποίθει·
αὐτοὶ μετὰ αὐλῶν καὶ κιθάρας πολεμήσουσιν αὐτὸν ἐκ μεταβολῆς.
οὐ γὰρ σὺ πρὸ ἡμερῶν ἀπατηθήσῃ·
μὴ καὶ <σοὶ> ἡτοιμάσθη βασιλεύειν, φάραγγα βαθεῖαν, ξύλα κείμενα, πῦρ καὶ ξύλα πολλά, ὁ θυμὸς Κυρίου ὡς φάραγξ ὑπὸ θείου καιομένη.
Οὐαὶ οἱ καταβαίνοντες εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐπὶ βοήθειαν, οἶ ἐφ’ ἵπποις πεποιθότες καὶ ἐφ’ ἅρμασιν·
ἔστιν γὰρ πολλά, καὶ ἐφ’ ἵπποις, πλῆθος σφόδρα·
καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν πεποιθότες ἐπὶ τᾶν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὸν θεὸν οὐκ ἐξεζήτησαν.
καὶ αὐτὸς σοφὸς ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς κακά, καὶ ὃ λόγος αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ ἀθετηθῇ, καὶ ἐπαναστή- σεται ἐπ’ οἴκους ἀνθρώπων πονηρῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν ἐλπίδα αὐτῶν τήν ματαίαν, Αἰγύπιον ἄνθρωπον, καὶ οὐ θεόν, ἵππων σάρκας, καὶ ἔστιν βοήθεια·
ὁ δὲ κύριος ἐπάξει τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ κοπιάσουσιν οἱ βοηθοῦντες, καὶ ἅμα πάντες ἀπολοῦνται.
ὅτι οὕτως εἶπέν μοι Κύριος Ὃν τρόπον ἐὰν λέων ἦ ὃ σκύμνος ἐπὶ τῇ θήρᾳ ᾗ ἔλαβεν, καὶ κεκράξῃ ἐπ’ αὐτῇ ἕως ἂν ἐμπλησθῇ τὰ.
ὄρη τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡττήθησαν καὶ τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ θυμοῦ ἐπτοήθησαν, οὕτως καταβήσεται Κύριος σαβαὼθ ἐπιστρατεῦσαι ἐπὶ τὸ ὅρος τὸ Σιών, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη αὐτῆς.
ὡς ὄρνεα πετόμενα, οὕτως Κύριος ὑπὲρ Ἰερουσαλὴμ καὶ ἐξελεῖται καὶ περιποιήσεται καὶ σώσει.
ἐπιστράφητε, οἶ τὴν βαθεῖαν βουλὴν βουλευσάμενοι καὶ ἄνομον.
ὅτι τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀπαρνηθήσονται οἶ ἅνθρωποι τὰ χειροποίητα αὐτῶν τὸ, ἀργυρᾶ καὶ τὰ χρυσᾶ ἅ ἐποίησαν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν.
καὶ πεσεῖται Ἀσσούρ·
οὗ μάχαιρα ἀνδρὸς οὐδὲ μάχαιρα ἀνθρώπου καταφάγεται αὐτόν, καὶ φεύξεται οὐκ ἀπὸ προσώπου διώκοντος·
οἱ δὲ νεανίσκοι ἔσονται εἷς ἥττημα, πέτρᾳ γὰρ περιλημφθήσονται ὡς χάρακι καὶ ἡττηθήσονται, ὃ δὲ φεύγων ἁλώσεται.
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Μακάριος ὃς ἔχει ἐν Σιὼν σπέρμα καὶ οἰκείους ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ.
Ἰδοὺ γὰρ βασιλεὺς δίκαιος βασιλεύσει, καὶ ἄρχοντες μετὰ κρίσεως ἄρξουσιν.
καὶ ἔσται ὃ ἅνθρωπος κρύπτων τοὺς λόγους τούτους, καὶ κρυβήσεται ὡς ἀφ’ ὕδατος φερομένου·
καὶ φανήσεται ἐν Σιὼν ὡς ποταμὸς φερόμενος ἔνδοξος ἐν γῇ διψώσῃ.
καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσονται πεποιθότες ἐπ’ ἀνθρώποις, ἀλλὰ.
τὰ.
ὦτα δώσουσιν ἀκούειν·
καὶ ἡ καρδία τῶν ἀσθενῶν προσέξει τοῦ ἀκούειν, καὶ αἱ γλῶσσαι αἱ ψελλίζουσαι ταχὺ μαθήσονται λαλεῖν εἰρήνην·
καὶ οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ εἴπωσιν τῷ μωρῷ ἄρχειν, καὶ οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ εἴπωσιν οἱ ὑπηρέται σου Σίγα.
ὁ γὰρ μωρὸς μωρὰ λαλήσει, καὶ ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν μάταια νοήσει, τοῦ συντελεῖν ἄνομα καὶ λαλεῖν πρὸς Κύριον πλάνησιν, τοῦ διαφθεῖραι ψυχὰς πεινώσας, καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς τὰς διψώσας κενὰς ποιῆσαι.
ἡ γὰρ βουλὴ τῶν πονηρῶν ἄνομα βουλεύεται, καταφθεῖραι ταπεινοὺς ἐν λόγοις ἀδίκοις καὶ διασκεδάσαι λογισμοὺς ταπεινῶν ἐν κρίσει.
οἱ δὲ εὐσεβεῖς συνετὰ ἐβουλεύσαντο, καὶ αὕτη ἡ βουλὴ μενεῖ.
Γυναῖκες πλούσιαι, ἀνάστητε καὶ ἀκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου·
θυγατέρες ἐν ἐλπίδι, ἀκούσατε τοὺς λόγους μου.
ἡμέρας ἐνιαυτοῦ μνείαν ποιήσασθε ἐν ὀδύνῃ μετὰ ἐλπίδος·
ἀνήλωται ὁ τρυγητός, πέπαυται ὁ σπόρος καὶ οὐκέτι μὴ ἔλθῃ.
ἔκστητε, λυπήθητε αἱ πεποιθυῖαι, ἐκδύσασθε, γυμναὶ γένεσθε, περιζώσασθε σάκκους τὰς ὀσφύας, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν μασθῶν κόπτεσθε, περὶ ἀγροῦ ἐπιθυμήματος καὶ ἀμπέλου γενήματος.
ἡ γῆ τοῦ λαοῦ μου, ἄκανθα καὶ χόρτος ἀναβήσεται, καὶ ἐκ πάσης οἰκίας εὐφροσύνη ἀρθήσεται·
πόλις πλουσία, οἶκοι ἐγκαταλελιμμένοι, πλοῦτον πόλεως καὶ οἴκους ἐπιθυμήτους ἀφήσουσιν·
καὶ ἔσονται αἱ κῶμαι σπήλαια ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος, εὐφροσύνη ὄνων ἀγρίων, βοσκήματα ποιμένων, ἕως ἂν ἐπέλθῃ ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς πνῦμα ἀφ’ ὑψηλοῦ.
καὶ ἔσται ἔρημος ὁ Χερμέλ, καὶ ὁ Χερμὲλ εἰς δρυμὸν λογισθήσεται.
καὶ ἀναπαύσεται ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ κρίμα, καὶ δικαιοσύνη ἐν τῷ Καρμήλῳ κατοικήσει·
καὶ ἔσται τὰ.
ἔργα τῆς δικαιοσύνης εἰρήνη, καὶ κρατήσει ἡ δικαιοσύνη ἀνάπαυσιν, καὶ πεποιθότες ἔσονται ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος·
καὶ κατοικήσει ὁ λαὸς αὑτοῦ ἐν πόλει εἰρήνης, καὶ ἐνοικήαἰῶνος·
σει πεποιθώς, καὶ ἀναπαύσονται μετὰ πλούτου.
ἡ δὲ χάλαζα ἐὰν καταβῇ, οὐκ ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἥξει.
καὶ ἔσονται οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν τοῖς δρυμοῖς πεποιθότες ὡς οἱ ἐν τῇ πεδινῇ.
μακράριοι οἶ σπείροντες ἐπὶ πᾶν ὕδωρ, οὗ βοῦς καὶ ὄνος πατεῖ.
Οὐαὶ τοῖς ταλαιπωροῦσιν ὑμᾶς, ὑμᾶς, δὲ οὐδεὶς ποιεῖ ταλαιπώρους, καὶ ὃ ἀθετῶν ὑμῖν οὐκ ἀθετεῖ·
ἁλώσονται οἶ ἀθετοῦντες καὶ παραδοθήσονται, καὶ ὡς σὴς ἐπὶ ἱματίου οὕτως ἡττηθήσονται.
Κύριε, ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς, ἐπὶ σοὶ γὰρ πεποίθαμεν·
ἐγενήθη τὸ σπέρμα τῶν ἀπειθούντων εἷς ἀπώλειαν, ἡ δὲ σωτηρία ἡμῶν ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως.
διὰ φωνὴν τοῦ φόβου σου ἐξέστησαν λαοὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου σου καὶ διεσπάρησαν τὰ ἔθνη.
νῦν δὲ συναχθήσεται τὰ σκῦλα ὑμῶν ἀπὸ μικροῦ καὶ μεγάλου·
ὃν τρόπον ἐάν τις συναγάγῃ ἀκρίδας, οὕτως ἐμπαίξονται ὑμῖν.
ἅγιος ὃ θεὸς ὃ κατοικῶν ἐν ὑψηλοῖς, ἐνεπλήσθη Σιὼν κρίσεως καὶ δικαιοσύνης.
ἐν νόμῳ παραδοθήσονται, ἐν θησαυροῖς ἡ σωτηρία ἡμῶν, ἐκεῖ σοφία καὶ ἐπιστήμη καὶ εὐσέβεια πρὸς τὸν κύριον·
οὗτοί εἰσιν θησαυροὶ δικαιοσύνης.
Ἰδοὺ δὴ ἐν τῷ φόβῳ ὑμῶν αὐτοὶ φοβηθήσονται·
οὓς ἐφοβεῖσθε, φοβηθήσονται ἀφ’ ὑμῶν·
ἄγγελοι γὰρ ἀποσταλήσονται ἀξιοῦντες εἰρήνην, πικρῶς κλαίοντες, παρακαλοῦντες εἰρήνην.
ἐρημωθήσονται γὰρ αἱ τούτων ὁδοί·
πέπαυται γὰρ ὁ φόβος τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἡ πρὸς τούτους διαθήκη αἴρεται, καὶ οὗ μὴ λογίσησθε αὐτοὺς ἀνθρώπους.
ἐπένθησεν ἡ γῆ, ᾐσχύνθη ὃ Λίβανος, ἕλη ἐγένετο ὃ Σαρών·
φανερὰ ἔσται ἡ Γαλιλαία καὶ ὃ Κάρμηλος.
νῦν ἀναστήσομαι, λέγει Κύριος, νῦν δοξασθήσομαι, νῦν ὑψωθήσομαι.
νυν ὄψεσθε, νῦν αἰσχυνθήσεσθε·
ματαία ἔσται ἡ ἰσχὺς τοῦ πνεύματος ὑμῶν, πῦρ ὑμᾶς κατέδεται, καὶ ἔσονται ἔθνη κατακεκαυμένα ὡς ἄκανθα ἐν ἀγρῷ ἐρριμμένη καὶ κατακεκαυμένη.
Ἀκούσονται οἱ πόρρωθεν ἃ ἐποίησα, γνώσονται οἱ ἐγγίζοντες τὴν ἰσχύν μου.
ἀπέστησαν οἱ ἐν Σιὼν ἄνομοι, λήμψεται τρόμος τοὺς ἀσεβεῖς·
τίς ἀναγγελεῖ ὑμῖν ὅτι πῦρ καίεται;
τίς ἀναγγελεῖ ὑμῖν τὸν τόπον τὸν αἰώνιον, πορευόμενος ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, λαλῶν εὐθεῖαν ὁδόν, μισῶν ἀνομίαν καὶ ἀδικίαν, καὶ τὰς χεῖρας ἀποσειόμενος ἀπὸ δώρων, βαρύνων τὰ ὦτα ἴνα μὴ ἀκούσῃ κρίσιν αἵματος, καμμύων τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἵνα μὴ ἴδῃ ἀδικίαν, οὗτος οἰκήσει ἐν ὑψηλῷ σπηλαίῳ πέτρας ὀχυρᾶς·
ἄρτος αὐτῷ δοθήσεται, καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ αὑτοῦ πιστόν.
βασιλέα μετὰ δόξης ὄψεσθε, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὑμῶν ὄψονται γῆν πόρρωθεν·
ἡ ὑμῶν μελετήσει φόβον Κυρίου.
ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ γραμματικοί;
ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ συμβουλεύοντες;
ποῦ ἐστιν ὃ ἀριθμῶν τοὺς συστρεφομένους;
μικρὸν καὶ μέγαν λαόν,ᾦ οὐ συνεβούλευσαν, οὐδὲ ᾔδει·
βαθύφωνον, ὥστε μὴ ἀκοῦσαι·
λαὸς πεφαυλισμένος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν τῷ ἀκούοντι σύνεσις.
ἰδοὺ Σιὼν ἡ πόλις, τὸ σωτήριον ἡμῶν, οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου ὄψονται Ἰερουσαλήμ, πόλις πλουσία, σκηναὶ αἲ οὗ μὴ σεισθῶσιν, οὐδ’ οὐ μὴ κινηθῶσιν οἶ πάσσαλοι τῆς σκηνῆς αὐτῆς εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον, οὐδὲ τὰ σχοινία αὐτῆς οὗ μὴ διαρραγῶσιν·
ὅτι τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου μέγα ἐστίν.
τόπος ὑμῖν ἔσται, ποταμοὶ καὶ διώρυγες πλατεῖς καὶ εὐρύχωροι·
οὐ πορεύσῃ ταύτην τὴν ὁδόν, οὐδὲ πορεύσεται πλοῖον ἐλαῦνον.
ὁ γὰρ θεός μου μέγας ἐστίν·
οὗ παρελεύσεταί με, Κύριος πατήρ, Κύριος κριτὴς ἡμῶν, Κύριος ἅρχων ἡμῶν, Κύριος βασιλεὺς ἡμῶν, Κύριος οὗτος ἡμᾶς σώσει.
ἐρράγησαν τὰ σχοινία σου, ὅτι οὐκ ἐνίσχυσεν·
ὃ ἱστός σου·
ἔκλινεν, οὐ χαλάσει τὸ.
ἱστία, οὐκ ἀρεῖ σημεῖον, ἕως οὗ παραδοθῇ εἷς προνομήν·
τοίνυν πολλοὶ χωλοὶ προνομὴν ποιήσουσιν.
καὶ οὐ μὴ εἴπῃ Κοπιῶ ὅ λαὸς ὃ ἐνοικῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς·
ἀφέθη γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἡ ἁμαρτία.
προσαγάγετε, ἔθνη, καὶ ἀκούσατε, ἄρχοντες·
ἀκουσάτω ἡ γῆ καὶ οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ, ἦ οἰκουμένη καὶ ὃ λαὸς ὃ ἐν αὐτῇ.
διότι θυμὸς Κυρίου ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ὀργὴ ἐπὶ τὸν ἀριθμὸν αὐτῶν, τοῦ ἀπολέσω αὐτοὺς καὶ παραδοῦναι αὐτοὺς εἷς σφαγήν.
οἱ δὲ τραυματίαι αὐτῶν ῥιφήσονται καὶ οἱ νεκροί, καὶ ἀναβήσεται αὐτῶν ἡ ὀσμή, καὶ βραχήσεται τὰ ὅρη ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτῶν.
καὶ ἐλιγήσεται ὃ οὐρανὸς ὡς βιβλίον, καὶ πάντα τὸ, ἄστρα πεσεῖται ὡς φύλλα ἐξ ἀμπέλου, καὶ ὡς πίπτει φύλλα ἀπὸ συκῆς.
ἐμεθύσθη ἡ μάχαιρά μου ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ·
ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν καταβήσεται καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τῆς ἀπωλείας μετὰ κρίσεως.
ἡ μάχαιρα μάχαιρα Κυρίου ἐνεπλήσθη αἵματος, ἐπαχύνθη ἀπὸ στέατος ἀρνῶν καὶ ἀπὸ στέατος τράγων καὶ κριῶν.
ὅτι θυσία Κυρίῳ ἐν γῆ Βόσορ, καὶ σφαγὴ μεγάλη ἐν τῇ Ἰδουμαίᾳ, καὶ συνπεσοῦνται οἱ ἁδροὶ μετ’ αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ κριοὶ καὶ οἶ ταῦροι, καὶ μεθυσθήσεται ἡ γῆ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ στέατος αὐτῶν ἐμπλησθήσεται.
ἡμέρα γὰρ κρίσεως Κυρίου, καὶ ἐνιαυτὸς ἀνταποκαὶ δόσεως κρίσεως Σιών στραφήσονται αὐτῆς αἱ φάραγγες εἰς πίσσαν, καὶ ἡ γῆ αὐτῆς εἷς θεῖον·
καὶ ἔσται αὐτῆς ἦ γῆ καιομένη ὥς πίσσα νυκτὸς νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας, καὶ οὐ σβεσθήσεται εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον, καὶ ἀναβήσεται ὁ καπνὸς αὐτῆς ἄνω, εἷς γενεὰς ἐρημωθήσεται.
καὶ καὶ κατοικήσονται ἐν αὐτῇ ὄρνεα καὶ ἐχῖνοι καὶ ἴβεις καὶ κόρακες·
καὶ ἐπιβληθήσεται ἐπ’ αὐτῇ σπαρτίον γεωμετρίας ἐρήμου, καὶ ABBREV ὀνοκένταυροι οἰκήσουσιν ἐν αὐτῇ.
οἶ ἄρχοντες αὐτῆς οὔκ ἔσονται·
οἱ γὰρ βασιλεῖς αὐτῆς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῆς καὶ οἶ μεγιστᾶνες αὐτῆς ἔσονται εἰς ἀπώλειαν.
καὶ ἀναφύσει εἷς τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν ἄκανθα, καὶ εἷς τὸ, ὀχυρώματα αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔσται ἐπαύλεις σειρήνωι καὶ αὐλὴ στρουθῶν·
καὶ συναντήσουσιν δαιμόνια ὀνοκενταύροις, καὶ βοήσονται ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον·
ἐκεῖ ἀναπαύσονται ὀνοκένταυροι, εὗρον γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἀνάπαυσιν.
ἐκεῖ ἐνόσσευσεν ἐχῖνος, καὶ ἔσωσεν ἡ γῆ τὸ.
παιδία αὐτῆς μετὰ ἀσφαλείας·
ἐκεῖ ἔλαφοι συνήντησαν καὶ ἴδον τὰ πρόσωπα ἀλλήλων·
ἀριθμῷ παρῆλθον, καὶ μία αὐτῶν οὐκ ἀπώλετο, ἑτέρα τὴν ἑτέραν οὐκ ἐξεζήτησαν, ὅτι Κύριος ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ συνήγαγεν αὐτάς.
καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπιβαλεῖ αὐτοῖς κλήρους, καὶ ἡ χεὶρ αὑτοῦ διεμέρισεν βόσκεσθαι·
εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον κληρονομήσατε, εἷς γενεὰς γενεῶν ἀναπαύσονται ἐπ’ αύηῆς.
Εὐφράνθητι, ἔρημος ἡ διψῶσα, ἀγαλλιάσθω ἔρημος καὶ ἀνθείτω ὡς κρίνον, καὶ ἐξανθήσει καὶ ἀγαλλιάσεται τὰ ἔρημα τοῦ Ἰορδάνου·
καὶ ἡ δόξα τοῦ Λιβάνου ἐδόθη αὐτῇ καὶ ἡ τιμὴ τοῦ Καρμήλου, καὶ ὃ λαός μου ὄψεται τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου καὶ τὸ ὕψος τοῦ θεοῦ.
ἰσχύσατε, χεῖρες ἀνειμέναι καὶ γόνατα παραλεφοβεῖσθε·
παρακαλέσατε, οἱ ὀλιγόψυχοι τῇ διανοίᾳ·
ἰσχύσατε, μὴ φοβεῖσθε·
ἰδοὺ ὃ θεὸς ἡμῶν κρίσιν ἀνταποδώσει καὶ ἀνταποδώσει, αὐτὸς ἥξει καὶ σώσει τότε ἀνοιχθήσονται ὀφθαλμοὶ τυφλῶν, καὶ ὦτα κωφῶν ἀκούσονται.
τότε ἀλεῖται ὡς ἔλαφος ὁ χωλός, καὶ τρανὴ ἔσται γλῶσσα μογιλάλων, ὅτι ἐρράγη ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ὕδωρ καὶ φάραγξ ἐν γῇ διψώσῃ, καὶ ἡ ἄνυδρος ἔσται εἷς ἕλη, καὶ εἷς τὴν διψῶσαν γῆν πηγὴ ὕδατος ἔσται·
ἐκεῖ εὐφροσύνη ὀρνέων, ἐπαύλεις καλάμου καὶ ἕλη.
ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁδὸς καθαρά, καὶ ὁδὸς ἁγία κληθήσεται, καὶ οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ ἐκεῖ ἀκάθαρτος, οὐδὲ ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁδὸς ἀκάθαρτος·
οἶ δὲ διεσπαρμένοι πορεύσονται ἐπ’ αὐτῆς, καὶ οὗ μὴ πλανηθῶσιν.
καὶ οὔκ ἔσται ἐκεῖ λέων, οὐδὲ τῶν θηρίων τῶν πονηρῶν οὗ μὴ ἀναβῇ ἐπ’ αὐτὴν οὐδὲ μὴ εὑρεθῇ ἐκεῖ, ἀλλὰ πορεύευρον σονται ἐν αὐτῇ λελυτρωμένοι καὶ συνηγμένοι διὰ Κύριον·
ἀποστραφήσονται καὶ ἥξουσιν εἰς Σιὼν μετ’ εὐφροσύνης, καί εὐφροσύνη αἰώνιος ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν·
ἐπὶ γὰρ κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν αἴνεσις καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα, καὶ καταλήμψεται αὐτούς·
ἀπέδρα ὀδύνη καὶ λύπη καὶ στεναγμός.
Καὶ ἐγένετο τοῦ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτου ἔτους βασιλεύοντος Ἑζεκίου ἀνέβη Σενναχηρεὶμ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις τῆς Ἰουδαίας τὰς ὀχυρὰς καὶ συνέλαβεν αὐτάς.
καὶ ἀπέστειλεν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων Ῥαψάκην ἐκ Λαχεὶς εἷς Ἰερουσαλὴμ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἐζεκίαν μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς, καὶ ἔστη ἐν τῷ ὑδραγωγῷ τῆς κολυμβήθρας τῆς ἅνω, ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ ἀγροῦ τοῦ γναφέως.
καὶ ἐξῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἐλιακεὶμ ὃ τοῦ Χελκίου οἰκονόμος καὶ Σόμνας ὁ γραμματεὺς καὶ Ἰωὰχ ὁ τοῦ Ἀσὰφ ὁ ὑπομνηματογράφος.
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ῥαψάκης Εἴπατε Τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ μέγας βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων Τί πεποιθὼς εἶ μὴ ἐν βουλῇ ἢ ἐν λόγοις χειλέων παράταξις γίνεται;
καὶ νῦν ἐπὶ τίνι πέποιθας ὅτι ἀπειθεῖς μοι;
ἰδοὺ πεποιθὼς εἶ ἐπὶ τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν καλαμίνην τὴν τεθλασμένην ταύτην, ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον·
ὃς ἂν ἐπιστηριχθῇ ἐπ’ αὑτήν, εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ·
οὕτως ἐστὶν Φαραὼ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου καὶ πάντες οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπ’ αὐτῷ.
εἰ δὲ λέγετε Ἐπὶ Κύριον τὸν θεὸν ἡμῶν πεποίθαμεν, νῦν μίχθητε τῷ κυρίῳ μου βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν δισχιλίαν ἵππον, εἰ δυνήσεσθε δοῦναι ἀναβάτας ἐπ’ αὐτούς.
καὶ πῶς δύνασθε ἀποστρέψαι τὸ πρόσωπον τοπάρχου ἑνός;
οἰκέται εἰσὶν οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπ’ Αἰγυπτίοις, εἰς ἵππον καὶ ἀναβάτην.
καὶ νῦν μὴ ἄνευ Κυρίου ἀνέβημεν ἐπὶ τὴν χώραν ταύτην πολεμῆσαι Καὶ αὐτήν;
καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὑτὸν Ἐλιακεὶμ καὶ Σόμνας ὃ γραμματεὺς καὶ Ἰωάχ Λάλησον πρὸς τοὺς παῖδάς σου Συριστί, ἀκούομεν γὰρ ἡμεῖς, καὶ μὴ λάλει πρὸς ἡμᾶς Ἰουδαιστί·
καὶ ἶνα τί λαλεῖς εἰς τὰ ὦτα τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν καθημένων ἐπὶ τῷ τείχει;
καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ῥαψάκης Μὴ πρὸς τὸν κύριον ὑμῶν ἢ πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἀπέσταλκέν με ὁ κύριός μου λαλῆσαι τοὺς λόγους τούτους;
οὐχὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς καθημένους ἐπὶ τῷ τείχει, ἵνα φάγωσιν κόπρον καὶ πίωσιν οὖρον μεθ’ ὑμῶν ἅμα;
καὶ ἔστη Ῥαψάκης, καὶ ἐβόησεν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Ἰουδαιστὶ καὶ εἶπεν Ἀκούσατε τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ μεγάλου βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων Τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς Μὴ ὑμᾶς ἀπατάτω Ἑζεκίας λόγοις, οἶ οὐ μὴ δυνήσονται ῥύσασθαι ὑμᾶς·
καὶ μὴ λεγέτω ὑμῖν Ἑζεκίας ὅτι Ῥύσεται ὑμᾶς ὁ θεός, καὶ οὔ μὴ παραδοθῇ ἡ πόλις αὕτη ἐν χειρὶ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων μὴ ἀκούετε Ἑζεκίου·
τάδε λέγει ὃ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων Εἰ βούλεσθε εὐλογηθῆναι, ἐκπορεύεσθε πρὸς μέ, καὶ φάγεσθε ἕκαστος τὴν ἄμπελον αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς συκᾶς, καὶ πίεσθε ὕδωρ τοῦ λάκκου ὑμῶν, ἔως ἂν ἔλθω καὶ λάβω ὑμᾶς εἷς γῆν ὡς ἦ γῆ ὑμῶν, γῆ σίτου καὶ οἴνου καὶ ἄρτων καὶ ἀμπελώνων.
μὴ ὑμᾶς ἀπατάτω Ἑζεκίας λέγων Ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν ῥύσεται ὑμᾶς.
μὴ ἐρρύσαντο οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ χώραν ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων;
ποῦ ἐστιν ὁ θεὸς Αἱμὰρ καὶ Ἀρφάθ;
καὶ ὃ θεὸς τῆς πόλεως Σεπφαρείμ;
μὴ ἐδύναντο ῥύσασθαι.
Σαμάρειαν ἐκ χειρός μου;
τίς τῶν θεῶν πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν τούτων ἐρρύσατο τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς χειρός μου, ὅτι ῥύσεται ὃ θεὸς τὴν Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐκ χειρός μου;
καὶ ἐσιώπησαν, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ λόγον, διὰ τὸ προστάξαι τὸν βασιλέα μηδένα ἀποκριθῆναι.
καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰσῆλθεν ὁ τοῦ Χελκιίου ὁ οἰκονόμος καὶ Σόμνας ὁ γραμματεὺς τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ Ἰωάχ ὁ τοῦ Ασὰφ ὁ ὑπομνηματογράφος πρὸς Ἐζεκίαν ἐσχισμένοι τοὺς χιτῶνας καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ τοὺς λόγους Ραψακου.
καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι τὸν βασιλέα Ἐζεκίαν ἔσχισεν τὰ ἱμάτια καὶ σάκκον περιεβάλετο καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου.
καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἐλιακεὶμ τὸν οἰκονόμον καὶ Σόμναν τὸν γραμματέα καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῶν ἱερέων περιβεβλημένους σάκκους πρὸς Ἠσαίαν υἱὸν Ἀμὼς τὸν προφήτην, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ Τάδε λέγει Ἐζεκὶας Ἡμέρα θλίψεως καὶ ὀνειδισμοῦ καὶ ἐλεγμοῦ καὶ ὀργῆς ἡ σήμερον ἡμέρα, ὅτι ἥκει ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ τικτούσῃ, ἰσχὺν δὲ οὐκ ἔχει τοῦ τεκεῖν.
εἰσακούσαι κύριος ὁ θεός σου τοὺς λόγους Ῥαψάκου, οὓς ἀπέστειλεν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ὀνειδίζειν θεὸν ζῶντα καὶ ὀνειδίζειν λόγους οὓς ἤκουσεν κύριος ὁ θεός σου·
καὶ δεηθήσῃ πρὸς κύριον τὸν θεόν σου περὶ τῶν καταλελειμμένων τούτων.
καὶ ἦλθον οἱ παῖδες τοῦ βασιλέως πρὸς Ἠσαίαν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ἠσαίας Οὕτως ἐρεῖτε πρὸς τὸν κύριον ὑμῶν Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπὸ τῶν λόγων, ὧν ἤκουσας, οὓς ὠνείδισάν με οἱ πρέσβεις βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων·
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐμβαλῶ εἰς αὐτὸν πνεῦμα, καὶ ἀκούσας ἀγγελίαν ἀποστραφήσεται εἰς τὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ καὶ πεσεῖται μαχαίρᾳ ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ῥαψάκης καὶ κατέλαβεν πολιορκοῦντα τὸν βασιλέα Λόβνα·
καὶ ἤκουσεν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν Θαράθα βασιλεὺς Αἰθιόπων πολιορκῆσαι αὐτόν·
καὶ ἀκούσας ἀπέστρεψεν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Εζεκιαν λέγων Οὕτως ἐρεῖτε Ἐζεκία βασιλεῖ τῆς Ιουδαίας Μή σε ἀπατάτω ὁ θεός σου, ἐφ᾽ ᾧ πεποιθὼς εἶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ λέγων Οὐ μὴ παραδοθῇ Ἰερουσαλὴμ εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων.
ἢ οὐκ ἤκουσας ἃ ἐποίησαν βασιλεῖς Ἀσσυρίων πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, ὡς ἀπώλεσαν;
μὴ ἐρρύσαντο αὐτοὺς οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν, οὓς οἱ πατέρες μου ἀπώλεσαν, τήν τε Γωζὰν καὶ Χαρρὰν καὶ Ῥάφεις, αἴ εἰσιν ἐν χώρᾳ Θαιμάδ;
ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ βασιλεῖς Ἁμὰρ καὶ Ἀρφάθ;
καὶ πόλεως Σεπφαρείμ, Ἁνά, Ἐγγουγαυά;
καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἑζεκίας τὸ βιβλίον παρὰ τῶν ἀγγέλων, καὶ ἤνοιξεν αὐτὸ ἐναντίον Κυρίου.
καὶ προσηύξατο Ἑζεκίας πρὸς Κύριον λέγων Κύριε σαβαὼθ ὃ θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ ὃ καθήμενος ἐπὶ τῶν χερουβείμ, σὺ θεὸς μόνος εἶ πάσης βασιλείας τῆς οἰκουμένης, σὺ ἐποίησας τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν.
εἰσάκουσον, Κύριε, εἴσβεψον, Κύριε, καὶ ἴδε τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἀπέστειλεν Σενναχηρεὶμ ὀνειδίζειν θεὸν ζῶντα.
ἐπ' ἀληθείας γὰρ ἠρήμωσαν βασιλεῖς Ἀσσυρίων τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅλην καὶ τὴν χώραν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐνέβαλον τὰ.
εἴδωλα αὐτῶν εἷς τὸ πῦρ, οὗ γὰρ θεοὶ ἦσαν ἀλλὰ.
ἔργα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων, ξύλα καὶ λίθοι·
καὶ ἀπώλεσαν αὐτούς.
σὺ δὲ Κύριος ὃ θεὸς ἡμῶν, σῶσον ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν, ἵνα γνῷ πᾶσα βασιλεία τῆς γῆς ὅτι σὺ εἶ θεὸς μόνος.
Καὶ ἀπεστάλη Ἠσαίας υἱὸς Ἀμὼς πρὸς Ἐζεκίαν καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεὸς Ἰσραήλ Ἠκουσα ἅ προσηύξω πρὸς μὲ περὶ Σενναχηρεὶμ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων.
οὗτος ὁ λόγος ὃν ἐλάλησεν περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ θεός Ἐφαύλισέν σε καὶ ἐμυκτήρισέν σε παρθένος θυγάτηρ Σιών, ἐπὶ σοὶ κεφαλὴν ἐκίνησεν θυγάτηρ Ἰερουσαλήμ.
τίνα ὠνείδισας καὶ παρώξυνας;
ἢ πρὸς τίνα ὕψωσας τὴν φωνήν σου;
καὶ οὔκ ἤρας εἷς ὕψος τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου εἷς τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ;
ὅτι δι’ ἀγγέλων ὠνείδισας Κύριον·
σὺ γὰρ εἶπας Τῷ πλήθει τῶν ἁρμάτων ἐγὼ ἀνέβην εἷς ὕψος ὀρέων καὶ εἷς τὰ ἔσχατα τοῦ Λιβάνου, καὶ ἔκοψα τὸ ὕψος τῆς κέδρου αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ κάλλος Τῆς κυπαρίσσου, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἷς ὕψος μέρους τοῦ δρυμοῦ, καὶ ἔθηκα γέφυραν, καὶ ἠρήμωσα ὕδατα καὶ πᾶσαν συναγωγὴν ὕδατος.
οὐ ταῦτα ἤκουσας πάλαιἄ ἐγὼ ἐποίησα;
ἐξ ἀρχαίων ἡμερῶν συνέταξα, νῦν δὲ ἐπέδειξα ἐξερημῶσαι ἔθνη ἐν ὀχυροῖς καὶ ἐνοικοῦντας ἐν πόλεσιν ὀχυραῖς·
ἀνῆκα τὰς χεῖρας, καὶ ἐξηράνθησαν, καὶ ἐγένοντο ὡς χόρτος χλωρὸς ἐπὶ δωμάτων καὶ ὡς ἄγρωστις.
νῦν δὲ τὴν ἀνάπαυσίν σου καὶ τὴν ἔξοδόν σου καὶ τὴν εἴσοδόν σου ἐγὼ ἐπίσταμαι·
ὁ δὲ θυμός σου ὃν ἐθυμώθης καὶ ἡ πικρία σου ἀνέβη πρὸς μέ, καὶ ἐμβαλῶ φιμὸν εἰς τὴν ῥῖνά σου καὶ χαλινὸν εἰς τὰ χείλη σου, καὶ ἀποστρέψω σε τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἦλθες ἐν αὐτῇ.
τοῦτο δέ σοι τὸ σημεῖον·
φάγε τοῦτον τὸν ἐνιαυτὸν ἅ ἔσπαρκας, καὶ τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ δευτέρῳ τὸ κατάλειμμα, τῷ δὲ τρίτῳ σπείραντες ἀμήσατε καὶ φυτεύσατε ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ φάγεσθε τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῶν.
καὶ ἔσονται οἱ καταλελειμμένοι ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ, φυήσουσιν ῥίζαν κάτω καὶ ποιήσουσιν σπέρμα ἄνω.
ὄτι ἐξ Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐξελεύσονται οἱ καταλελειμμένοι, καὶ οἱ σωζόμενοι ἐπ’ ὅρους Σιών·
ὁ ζῆλος Κυρίου σαβαὼθ ποιήσει ταῦτα.
διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ἐπὶ βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων Οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς τὴν πόλιν ταύτην, οὐδὲ μὴ βάλῃ ἐπ’ αὐτὴν βέλος, οὐδὲ μὴ βάλῃ ἐπ’ αὐτὴν θυρεόν, οὐδ᾿ οὐ μὴ κυκλώσει ἐπ’ αὐτὴν χάρακα·
ἀλλὰ τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἦλθεν, ἐν αὐτῇ ἀποστραφήσεται.
τάδε λέγει Κύριος Ὑπερασπιῶ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως ταύτης τοῦ σῶσαι αὐτὴν δι’ ἐμὲ καὶ διὸ.
Δαυεὶδ τὸν παῖδά μου.
Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἅγγελος Κυρίου καὶ ἀνεῖλεν ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς τῶν Ἀσσυρίων ἑκατὸν καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα πέντε χιλιάδας·
καὶ ἐξαναστάντες τὸ πρωὶ εὖρον πάντα τὰ σώματα νεκρά.
καὶ ἀποστραφεὶς ἀπῆλθεν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ᾤκησεν ἐν Νινευή.
καὶ ἐν τῷ αὐτὸν προσκυνεῖν ἐν οἰκῷ Ἀσαρὰχ τὸν πάτραρχον αὐτοῦ, Ἀδραμέλεχ καὶ Σαράσαρ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὸν μαχαίραις·
αὐτοὶ δὲ διεσώθησαν εἰς Ἀρμενίαν·
καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀσορδὰν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἐμαλακίσθη Ἑζεκίας ἕως θανάτου·
καὶ ἦλθεν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἠσαίας υἱὸς Ἀμὼς ὅ προφήτης καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Τάξαι περὶ τοῦ οἴκου σου, ὅτι ἀποθνήσκεις σὺ καὶ οὗ καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ἑζεκίας τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς Κύριον λέγων Μνήσθητι, Κύριε, ὡς ἐπορεύθην ἐνώπιόν σου μετὰ ἀληθείας ἐν καρδίᾳ ἀληθινῇ, καὶ τὸ, ἀρεστὰ ἐνώπιόν σου ἐποίησα·
καὶ ἔκλαυσεν Ἑζεκίας κλαυθμῷ μεγάλῳ.
καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἠσαίαν λέγων Πορεύου καὶ εἰπὸν πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὅ θεός Δαυεὶδ τοῦ πατρός σου Ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς Τῆς προσευχῆς σου καὶ ἴδον τὰ δάκρυά σου·
ἰδοὺ προστίθημι πρὸς τὸν χρόνον σου ἔτη δέκα πέντε·
καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων σώσω σε καὶ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως ταύτης ὑπερασπιῶ.
τοῦτο δέ σοι τὸ σημεῖον παρὰ.
Κυρίου ὅτι ὁ θεός ποιήσει τὸ τοῦτο.
ἰδοὺ στρέφω τὴν σκιὰν τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν οὓς κατέβη ὁ ἥλιος, τοὺς δέκα ἀναβαθμοὺς τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός σου, ἀποστρέψω τόν ἥλιον τοὺς δέκα ἀναβαθμούς.
καὶ ἀνέβη ὃ ἥλιος τοὺς δέκα ἀναβαθμοὺς οὕς κατέβη ἡ σκιά.
( Ὠιδή.
) Προσευχὴ Ἑζεκίου βασιλέως Τῆς Ἰουδαίας ἡνίκα ἐμαλακίσθη καὶ ἀνέστη ἐκ τῆς μαλακίας αὐτοῦ.
Ἐγὼ εἶπα Ἐν τῷ ὕψει τῶν ἡμερῶν μου ἐν πύλαις ᾅδου τὰ.
ἔτη τὸ, ἐπίλοιπα.
εἶπα Οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ ἴδω τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, οὐκέτι οὗ μὴ ἴδω ἄνθρωπον.
ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας μου κατέλιπον τὸ λοιπὸν τῆς ζωῆς μου, ἐξῆλθεν καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ ὥσπερ ὃ καταλύων σκηνὴν πήξας·
τὸ πνεῦμά μου παρ’ ἐμοὶ στὸς ἐρίθου ἐγγιζούσης ἐκτεμεῖν.
ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ παρεδόθην ἕως πρωὶ ὡς λέοντι, οὕτως τὸ.
ὀστᾶ μου συνέτριψεν·
ἀπὸ γὰρ τῆς ἡμέρας ἔως τῆς νυκτὸς παρεδόθην.
ὡς χελιδών, οὕτως φωνήσω, καὶ ὡς περιστερά, οὕτως μελετήσω·
ἐξέλιπον γάρ μου οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ τοῦ βλέπειν εἰς τὸ ὕψος τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πρὸς τὸν κύριον, ὃς ἐξείλατό με καὶ ἀφείλατό μου τὴν ὀδύνην τῆς ψυχῆς.
Κύριε, περὶ αὐτῆς γὰρ ἀνηγγέλη σοι, καὶ ἐξήγειράς μου τὴν πνοήν, καὶ παρακληθεὶς ἔζησα.
εἵλου γάρ μου τὴν ψυχὴν ἵνα μὴ ἀπόληται, καὶ ἀπέριχας ὀπίσω μου πάσας τὰς ἁμαρτίας μου.
οὐ γὰρ οἶ ἐν ᾅδου αἰνέσουσίν σε, οὐδὲ οἱ ἀποθανόντες εὐλογήουσίν σε, οὑδὲ ἐλπιοῦσιν οἶ ἐν ᾅδου τὴν ἐλεημοσύνην σου.
οἱ ζῶντες εὐλογήσουσίν σε ὃν τρόπον κἀγώ·
ἀπὸ γὰρ τῆς σήμερον παιδία ποιήσω,ἂ ἀναγγελοῦσιν τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου, Κύριε τῆς σωτηρίας μου·
καὶ οὗ παύσομαι εὐλογῶν σε μετὰ ψαλτηρίου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς μου κατέναντι τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ θεοῦ.
Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠσαίας πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν Λάβε παλάθην ἐκ σύκων καὶ τρίψον καὶ κατάπλασαι, καὶ ὑγιὴς ἔσῃ.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας Τοῦτο τὸ σημεῖον ὅτι ἀναβήσομαι εἷς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ.
Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀπέστειλεν Μαρωδὰχ υἱὸς τοῦ Λααδὰν ὃ βασιλεὺς Τῆς Βαβυλωνίας ἐπιστολὰς καὶ πρέσβεις καὶ δῶρα Ἐζεκίᾳ·
ἤκουσεν γὰρ ὅτι ἐμαλακίσθη ἕως θανάτου ἀνέστη.
αὐτοῖς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ νεχωθὰ καὶ τῆς στακτῆς καὶ τῶν θυμιαμάτων καὶ ἐχάρη ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς Ἑζεκίας χαρὰν μεγάλην, καὶ ἔδειξεν καὶ τοῦ μύρου καὶ τοῦ ἀργυρίου καὶ τοῦ χρυσίου, καὶ πάντας τοὺς οἴκους τῶν σκευῶν τῆς γάζης, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς αὑτοῦ·
καὶ οὐκ ἦν οὐθὲν ὃ οὐκ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς Ἑζεκίας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ.
καὶ ἦλθεν Ἠσαίας ὃ προφήτης πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἑζεκίαν καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν Τί λέγουσιν οἱ ἅνθρωποι οὗτοι, καὶ πόθεν ἥκασιν πρὸς σέ;
καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας Ἐκ γῆς πόρρωθεν ἥκασιν πρὸς μέ, ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἠσαίας Τί ἴδον ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου;
καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας Πάντα τὸ.
ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου ἴδοσαν, καὶ οὔκ ἔστιν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου ὃ οὐκ εἴδοσαν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ, ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς μου.
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἠσαίας Ἄκουσον τὸν λόγον Κύριου σαβαώθ.
Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ λήμψονται πάντα τὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου, καὶ ὅσα συνήγαγον οἱ πατέρες σου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ἥξει, καὶ οὐ μὴ καταλίπωσιν οὐδέν·
εἶπεν δὲ ὃ θεὸς ὅτι Καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν τέκνων σου ὧν ἐγέννησας λήμψονται, καὶ ποιήσουσιν σπάδοντας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν Βαβυλωνίων.
καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας πρὸς Ἠσαίαν Ἀγαθός ὃ λόγος Κυρίου ὃν ἐλάλησεν·
γενέσθω δὴ εἰρήνη καὶ δικαιοσύνη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις μου.
Παρακαλεῖτε, παρακαλεῖτε τὸν λαόν μου, λέγει Κύριος.
ἱερεῖς, λαλήσατε εἷς τὴν καρδίαν Ἰερουσαλήμ, παρακαλέσατε αὑτήν, ὅτι ἐπλήσθη ἡ ταπείνωσις αὐτῆς, λέλυται αὐτῆς ἡ ἁμαρτία, ὅτι ἐδέξατο ἐκ χειρὸς Κυρίου διπλᾶ τὰ ἁμαρτήματα αὐτῆς.
Φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδόν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν.
πᾶσα φάραγξ πληρωθήσεται, καὶ πᾶν ὅρος καὶ βουνὸς ταπεινωθήσεται·
καὶ ἔσται τὰ, σκολιὰ εἷς εὐθεῖαν, καὶ ἡ τραχεῖα εἷς ὁδοὺς λείας, καὶ ὀφθήσεται ἡ δόξα Κυρίου, καὶ ὄψεται πᾶσα σὰρξ τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ θεοῦ, ὅτι Κύριος ἐλάλησεν.
Φωνὴ λέγοντος Βόησον.
καὶ εἶπα Τί βοήσω;
Πᾶσα σὰρξ χόρτος, καὶ πᾶσα δόξα ἀνθρώπου ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου·
ἐξηράνθη ὃ χόρτος καὶ τὸ ἄνθος ἐξέπεσεν, τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν μένει εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα.
Ἐπ ὄρος ὑψηλὸν ἀνάβηθι, ὁ εὐαγγελιζόμενος Σιών·
ὕψωσον τῇ ἰσχύι τὴν φωνήν σου, ὃ εὐαγγελιζόμενος Ἰερουσαλήμ·
ὑψώσατε, μὴ φοιδον.
.

ιδοσαν] βεῖσθε·
εἶπόν ταῖς πόλεσιν Ἰούδα Ἰδοὺ ὃ θεὸς ὑμῶν.
Ἰδοὺ Κύριος μετὰ.
ἰσχύος ἔρχεται, καὶ ὅ βραχίων αὐτοῦ μετὰ κυρίας·
ἰδοὺ ὃ μισθὸς αὐτοῦ μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ἔργον ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ.
ὡς ποιμὴν ποιμανεῖ τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῷ βραχίονι αὐτοῦ συνάξει ἄρνας, καὶ έν γαστρὶ ἐχούσας παρακαλέσει.
Τίς ἐμέτρησεν τῇ χειρὶ τὰ ὕδωρ, καὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν σπιθαμῇ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν δρακί;
τίς ἔστησεν τὸ.
ὄρη σταθμῷ καὶ τὰς νάπας ζυγῷ;
τίς ἔγνω νοῦν Κυρίου, καὶ τίς σύμβουλος αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο, ὃς συμβιβάσει αὐτόν;
ἢ πρὸς τίνα συνεβουλεύσατο καὶ συνεβίβασεν αὐτόν,- ἢ τίς ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ κρίσιν;
ἢ ὁδὸν συνέσεως τίς ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ;
ἦ τίς προέδωκεν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀνταποδοθήσεται αὐτῷ;
εἰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ὧς σταγὼν ἀπὸ κάδου καὶ ὡς ζυγοῦ ἐλογίσθησαν, καὶ ὡς λογισθήσονται;
ὁ δὲ Λίβανος οὔχ ἱκανὸς εἷς καῦσιν, καὶ πάντα τά.
τετράποδα οὐχ ἱκανὰ εἷς ὁλοκάρπωσιν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ὡς οὐδέν εἰσιν, καὶ εἷς οὐθὲν ἐλογίσθησαν.
Τίνι ὡμοιώσατε Κύρων, καὶ τίνι ὁμοιώματι ὡμοιώσατε αὐτόν;
μὴ εἰκόνα ἐποίησεν τέκτων, ἢ χρυσοχόος χωνεύσας χρυσίον περιεχρύσωσεν αὐτόν;
ὁμοίωμα κατεσκεύασεν αὐτόν;
ξύλον γὰρ ἄσηπτον ἐκλέγεται τέκτων, καὶ σοφῶς ζητεῖ πῶς στήσει αὑτοῦ εἰκόνα, καὶ ἴνα μὴ σαλεύηται.
οὐ γνώσεσθε;
οὒκ ἀκούσεσθε;
οὐκ ἀνηγγέλη ἐξ ἀρχῆς ὑμῖν;
οὐκ ἔγνωτε τὰ θεμέλια τῆς γῆς;
ὁ κατέχων τὸν γῦρον τῆς γῆς, καὶ οἶ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ ὡς ἀκρίδες, ὁ στήσας ὥς καμάραν τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ διατείνας ὥς σκηνὴν κατοικεῖν, ὁ διδοὺς ἄρχοντας εἷς οὐδὲν ἄρχειν, τὴν δὲ γῆν οἷς οὐδὲν ἐποίησεν.
οὐ γὰρ μὴ σπείρωσιν οὐδὲ μὴ φυτεύσουσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ εἷς τὴν γῆν ἡ ῥίζα αὐτῶν·
ἔπνευσεν ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ ἐξηράνθησαν, καὶ καταιγὶς ὥς φρύγανα ἀναλήμψεται αὐτούς.
νῦν οὖν τίνι με ὡμοιώσατε, καὶ ὑψωθήσομαι;
εἶπεν ὁ ἅγιος.
ἀναβλέψατε εἷς τὸ ὕψος τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν καὶ ἴδετε·
τίς κατέδειξεν πάντα ταῦτα;
ὁ ἐκφέρων κατὰ ἀριθμὸν τὸν κόσμον αὐτοῦ, πάντα ἐπ’ ὀνόματι καλέσει ἀπὸ τῆς πολλῆς δόξης, καὶ ἐν κράτει ἰσχύος οὐδέν σε ἔλαθεν.
Μὴ γὰρ εἴπῃς, Ἰακώβ, καὶ τί ἐλόλησας, Ἰσραήλ Ἀπεκρύβη ἡ ὁδός μου ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ, καὶ ὁ θεός μου τὴν κρίσιν ἀφεῖλεν, καὶ ἀπέστη;
καὶ νῦν οὐκ ἔγνως;
εἰ μὴ ἤκουσας;
θεὸς αἰώνιος, θεὸς ὁ κατασκευάσας τὰ ἄκρα τῆς γῆς, οὐ πεινάσει οὐδὲ κοπιάσει, οὐδὲ ἔστιν ἐξεύρεσις τῆς φρονήσεως αὐτοῦ, διδοὺς τοῖς πεινῶσιν ἰσχύν, καὶ τοῖς μὴ ὀδυνωμένοις λύπην.
πεινάσουσιν γὰρ νεώτεροι, καὶ κοπιάσουσιν νεανίσκοι, καὶ ἐκλεκτοὶ ἀνίσχυες ἔσονται·
οἱ δὲ ὑπομένοντες τὸν θεὸν ἀλλάξουσιν ἰσχύν, πτεροφυήσουσιν ὡς ἀετοί, δραμοῦνται καὶ οὐ κοπιάσουσιν, βαδιοῦνται καὶ οὐ κεινάσουσιν.
Ἐγκαινίζεσθε πρὸς μέ, νῆσοι, οἱ γὰρ ἄρχοντες ἀλλάξουσιν ἰσχύν·
ἐγγισάτωσαν καὶ λαλησάτωσαν ἅμα, τότε κρίσεις ἀναγγειλάτωσαν.
τίς ἐξήγειρεν ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν δικαιοσύνην, ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὴν κατὰ πόδας αὐτοῦ, πορεύσεται·
δώσει ἐναντίον ἐθνῶν, καὶ βασιλεῖς ἐκστήσει·
καὶ δώσει εἰς γῆν τὰς μαχαίρας αὐτῶν, καὶ ὡς φρύγανα ἐξωσμένα τὰ τόξα αὐτῶν·
καὶ διώξεται αὐτούς.
καὶ διελεύσεται ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἡ ὁδὸς τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ.
τίς ἐνήργησεν καὶ ἐποίησεν ταῦτα;
ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὴν ὁ καλῶν αὐτὴν ἀπὸ γενεῶν ἀρχῆς·
ἐγὼ θεὸς πρῶτος, καὶ εἷς τὰ ἐπερχόμενα ἐγώ εἰμι.
εἴδοσαν ἔθνη καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν, τὰ.
ἄκρα τῆς γῆς ἤγγισαν καὶ ἤλθοσαν ἅμα, κρίνων ἕκαστος τῷ πλησίον καὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ βοηθῆσαι, καὶ ἐρεῖ Ἴσχυσεν ἀνὴρ τέκτων, καὶ χαλκεὺς τύπτων σφύρῃ, ἅμα ἐλαύνων·
τότε μὲν ἐρεῖ Σύμβλημα καλόν ἐστιν, ἰσχύρωσαν αὐτὰ ἐν ἥλοις·
θήσουσιν αὐτὰ.
καὶ οὐ κινηθήσονται.
Σὺ δέ, Ἰσραήλ, παῖς μουἸακὼβ ὃν ἐξελεξάμην, σπέρμα Ἀβραὰμ ὃν ἠγάπησα·
οὖ ἀντελαβόμην ἀπ’ ἄκρων τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐκ τῶν σκοπιῶν αὐτῆς ἐκάλεσά σε καὶ εἶπά σοι Παῖς μου εἴ, ἐξελεξάμην σε καὶ οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπόν σε.
μὴ φοβοῦ, μετὰ σοῦ γάρ εἰμι·
μὴ πλανῶ, ἐγὼ γάρ εἶμι ὁ θεός σου ὁ ἐνισχύσας σε, καὶ ἐβοήθησά σοι καὶ ἠσφαλισάμην σε τῇ δεξιᾷ τῇ δικαίᾳ μου.
ἰδοὺ ἰδοὺ αἰσχυνθήσονται καὶ ἐντραπήσονται πάντες οἶ ἀντικείμενοί σοι, ἔσονται γὰρ ὥς οὐκ ὄντες, καὶ ἀπολοῦνται πάντες οἶ ἀντίδικοί σου.
ζητήσεις αὐτούς, καὶ οὗ μὴ εὕρῃς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους οἱ παροινήσουσιν εἷς σέ·
ἔσονται γὰρ εἷς οὐκ ὄντες, καὶ οὐκ ἔσονταιοἶ ἀντιπολεμοῦντές σε.
ὅτι ἐγὼ ὁ θεὸς ὁ κρατῶν τῆς δεξιᾶς σου, ὁ λέγωνσοι Μὴ φοβοῦ, Ἰακώβ, ὀλιγοστὸς Ἰσραήλ ἐγὼ ἐβοήθησά σοι, λέγει ὁ θεὸς ὁ λυτρούμενός σε Ἰσραήλ.
ἰδοὺ ἐποίησά σε ὥς τροχοὺς ἁμάξης ἀλοῶντας καινοὺς πριστοειδεῖς, καὶ ἀλοήσεις ὅρη, καὶ λεπτυνεῖς βουνούς, καὶ ὦς χοῦν θήσεις, καὶ λικμήσεις, καὶ ἄνεμος λήμψεται αὐτούς, καὶ καταιγὶς διασπερεῖ αὐτούς.
σὺ δὲ εὐφρανθήσῃ ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀγαλλιάσονται οἶ πτωχοὶ καὶ οἶ ἐνδεεῖς.
ζητήσουσιν γὰρ ὕδωρ καὶ οὐκ ἔσται, ἡ γλῶσσα αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς δίψης ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ θεός, ἐγὼ ἐπακούσομαι ὁ θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψω αὐτούς, ἀλλὰ ἀνοίξω ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων ποταμοὺς καὶ ἐν μέσῳ πεδίων πηγάς, ποιήσω τὴν ἔρημον εἷς ἕλη, καὶ τὴν διψῶσαν γῆν ἐν ὑδραγωγοῖς, θήσω εἷς τὴν ἄνυδρον γῆν κέδρον καὶ πύξον, καὶ μυρσίνην καὶ κυπάρισσον καὶ λεύκην·
ἵνα ἴδωσιν καὶ γνῶσιν καὶ ἐννοηθῶσιν καὶ ἐπισπῶνται ἅμα ὅτι χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐποίησεν ταῦτα πάντα, καὶ ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ κατέδειξεν.
Ἐγγίζει ἡ κρίσις ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεός·
ἤγγισαν αἶ βουλαὶ ὑμῶν, λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰακώβ.
ἐγγισάτωσαν καὶ ἀναγγειλάτωσαν ὑμῖν ἅ συμβήσεται, ἢ τὰ πρότερα τίνα ἦν εἴπατε, καὶ ἐπιστήσομεν τὸν νοῦν, καὶ γνωσόμεθα τί τὸ, ἔσχατα, καὶ τὰ ἐπερχόμενα εἴπατε ἡμῖν.
ἀναγγείλατε τὸ.
ἐπερχόμενα ἐπ’ ἐσχάτου, καὶ γνωσόμεθα ὅτι θεοί ἐστε.
εὖ ποιήσατε καὶ κακώσατε, καὶ θαυμασόμεθα, ὅτι πόθεν ἐστὲ ὑμεῖς, καὶ πόθεν ἡ ἐργασία ὑμῶν, ἐκ γῆς·
βδέλυγμα ἐξελέξαντο ὑμᾶς.
ἐγὼ ἤγειρα τὸν ἀπὸ βορρᾶ καὶ τὸν ἀπ’ ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν, κληθήσονται τῷ ὀνόματί μου·
ἐρχέσθωσαν ἄρχοντες, καὶ αἷς πηλὸς κεραμέως, καὶ οἷς κεραμεὺς καταπατῶν τὸν πηλόν, οὕτως καταπατηθήσεσθε.
τίς γὰρ ἀναγγελεῖ τὰ, ἐξ ἀρχῆς, ἵνα γνῶμεν, καὶ τὰ ἔμπροσθεν, καὶ ἐροῦμεν ὅτι ἀληθῆ ἐστιν;
οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ προλέγων, οὐδ’ ἀκούων τοὺς λόγους ὑμῶν.
ἀρχὴν Σιὼν δώσω, καὶ Ἰερουσαλὴμ παρακαλέσω ἐν ὁδῷ.
ἀπὸ γὰρ τῶν ἐθνῶν ἰδοὺ οὐθείς, ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων αὐτῶν οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀναγγέλλων·
καὶ ἐὰν ἐρωτήσω αὐτοὺς πόθεν ἐστέ, οὐ μὴ ἀποκριθῶσίν μοι.
εἰσὶν γὰρ οἶ ποιοῦντες ὑμᾶς, καὶ μάτην οἱ πλανῶντες ὑμᾶς.
Ἰακὼβ ὁ παῖς μου, ἀντιλήμψομαι αὐτοῦ·
Ἰσραὴλ ὅ ἐκλεκτός μου, προσεδέξατο αὐτὸν ἦ ψυχή μου·
ἔδωκα τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐπ’ αὐτόν, κρίσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐξοίσει·
οὐ πράξεται οὐδὲ ἀνήσει, οὐδὲ ἀκουσθήσεται ἔξω ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ.
κάλαμον συντεθλασμένον οὐ συντρίψει, καὶ λίνον καπνιζόμενον οὗ σβέσει, ἀλλὰ εἷς ἀλήθειαν ἐξοίσει κρίσιν.
ἀναλάμψει καὶ οὗ θραυσθήσεται, ἕως ἂν θῇ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κρίσιν·
καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὑτοῦ ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν.
οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὁ ποιήσας τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ πήξας αὐτόν, ὃ στερεώσας τὴν γῆν καὶ τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ δοὺς πνοὴν τῷ λαῷ τῷ ἐπ’ αὐτῆς καὶ πνεῦμα τοῖς πατοῦσιν αὑτήν.
ἐγὼ Κύριος ὅ θεὸς ἐκάλεσέ σε ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, καὶ κρατήσω τῆς χειρός σου καὶ ἐνισχύσω σε, καὶ ἔδωκά σε εἷς διαθήκην γένους, εἷς φῶς ἐθνῶν, ἀνοῖξαι ὀφθαλμοὺς τυφλῶν, ἐξαγαγεῖν ἐκ δεσμῶν δεδεμένους καὶ ἐξ οἴκου φυλακῆς καθημένους ἐν σκότει.
ἐγὼ Κύριος ὅ θεός, τοῦτό μού ἐστιν τὸ ὄνομα, τὴν δόξαν μου ἑτέρω οὐ δώσω, οὐδὲ τὰς ἀρετάς μου τοῖς γλυπτοῖς.
τὰ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς ἰδοὺ ἥκασιν, καὶ καινὰ ἐγὼ ἀναγγελῶ, καὶ πρὸ τοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι ἐδηλώθη ὑμἰν.
Ὑμνήσατε τῷ κυρίῳ ὕμνον καινόν·
ἡ ἀρχὴ αὐτοῦ, δοξάζετε τὸ ὄνομα αὑτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄκρου τῆς γῆς, οἶ καταβαίνοντες εἷς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ πλέοντες αὑτήν, αἶ νῆσοι καὶ οἶ κατοικοῦντες αὐτάς.
εὐφράνθητι, ἔρημος καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῆς, ἐπαύλεις καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Κηδάρ.
εὐφρανθήσονται οἱ κατοικοῦντες πέτραν, ἐπ’ ἄκρων τῶν ὀρέων δώσουσιν τῷ θεῷ δόξαν, τὰς ἀρετὰς αὑτοῦ ἐν ταῖς νήσοις ἀναγγελοῦσιν.
Κύριος ὁ θεὸς τῶν δυνάμεων ἐξελεύσεται καὶ συντρίψει πόλεμον, ἐπεγερεῖ ζῆλον καὶ βοήσεται ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ μετὰ ἰσχύος.
ἐστώπησα, μὴ καὶ ἀεὶ σιωπήσομαι καὶ ἀνέξομαι;
ἐκαρτέρησα ὡς ἡ τίκτουσα, ἐκστήσω καὶ ξηρανῶ ἅμα.
καὶ θήσω ποταμοὺς εἰς νήσους, καὶ ἔλη ξηρανῶ.
καὶ ἄξω τυφλοὺς ἐν ὁδῷ ᾗ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν, καὶ τρίβους οὓς οὐκ ᾔδεισαν πατῆσαι ποιήσω αὐτούς·
ποιήσω αὐτοῖς τὸ σκότος εἷς φῶς, καὶ τὸ, σκολιὰ εἰς εὐθεῖαν.
ταῦτα τὸ.
ῥήματα ἃ ποιήσω, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψω αὐτούς·
αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀπεστράφησαν εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω.
αἰσχύνθητε αἰσχύνην, οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπὶ τοῖς γλυπτοῖς, οἱ λέγοντες τοῖς χωνευτοῖς Ὑμεῖς ἐστε θεοὶ ἡμῶν.
Οἱ κωφοί, ἀκούσατε, καὶ οἱ τυφλοί, ἀναβλέψατε ἰδεῖν.
καὶ τίς τυφλὸς ἀλλ’ ἢ οἱ παῖδές μου, καὶ κωφοὶ ἀλλ’ ἦ οἱ κυριεύοντες αὐτῶν;
καὶ ἐτυφλώθησαν οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ θεοῦ.
ἴδετε πλεονάκις, καὶ οὐκ ἐφυλάξασθε·
ἠνοιγμένα τὸ.
ὦτα, καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσατε.
Κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἐβουλεύσατο ἵνα δικαιωθῇ καὶ μεγαλύνῃ αἴνεσιν.
καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ λαὸς πεπρονομευμένος καὶ διηρπασμένος·
ἡ γὰρ παγὶς ἐν τοῖς ταμιείοις πανταχοῦ, καὶ ἐν οἴκοις ἅμα, ὅπου ἔκρυψαν αὐτούς, ἐγένοντο εἷς προνομήν·
καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐξαιρούμενος ἅρπαγμα, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ λέγων Ἀπόδος.
τίς ἐν ὑμῖν ὃς ἐνωτιεῖται ταῦτα;
εἰσακούσεται εἰς τὸ.
ἐπερχόμενα.
τίς ἔδωκεν εἰς διαρπαγὴν Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ τοῖς προνομεύουσιν αὐτόν;
οὐχὶ ὁ θεὸςᾦ ἡμάρτοσαν αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλοντο ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ πορεύεσθαι οὐδὲ ἀκούειν τοῦ νόμου αὐτοῦ;
καὶ ἐπήγαγεν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ὀργὴν θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατίσχυσεν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς πόλεμος, καὶ οἱ συμφλέγοντες αὐτοὺς κύκλῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἕκαστος αὐτῶν οὐδὲ ἔθεντο ἐπὶ ψυχήν.
Καὶ νῦν οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεός, ὁ ποιήσας σε Ἰακώβ, ὁ πλάσας σε Ἰσραήλ Μὴ φοβοῦ, ὅτι ἐλυτρωσάμην σε ἐκάλεσά σε τὸ ὄνομά σου, ἐμὸς εἶ σύ.
καὶ ἐὰν διαβαίνης δι’ ὕδατος, μετὰ σοῦ εἰμι, καὶ ποταμοὶ οὐ συγκλύσουσίν σε·
καὶ ἐὰν διέλθῃς διὰ πυρός, οὐ μὴ κατακαυθῇς, φλὸξ οὗ κατακαύσει σε.
ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ θεός σου, ὁ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ, ὁ σώζων σε·
ἐποίησά σου ἄλλαγμα Αἴγυπτον καὶ Αἰθιοπίαν, καὶ Σοήνην ὑπὲρ σοῦ.
ἀφ’ οὗ ἔντιμος ἐγένου ἐναντίον μου, ἐδοξάσθης κἀγώ σε ἠγάπησα, καὶ δώσω ἀνθρώπους πολλοὺς ὑπὲρ σοῦ καὶ ἄρχοντας ὑπὲρ τῆς κεφαλῆς σου.
μὴ φοβοῦ, ὅτι μετὰ σοῦ εἰμι·
ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἄξω τὸ σπέρμα σου καὶ ἀπὸ δυσμῶν συνάξω σε.
ἐρῶ τῷ βορρᾷ Ἄγε, καὶ τῷ λιβί Μὴ κώλυε·
ἄγε τοὺς υἱούς μου ἀπὸ γῆς πόρρωθεν, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας μου ἀπ’ ἄκρων τῆς γῆς, πάντας ὅσοι ἐπικέκληνται τῷ ὀνόματί μου.
ἐν γὰρ τῇ δόξῃ μου κατεσκεύασα αὐτὸν καὶ ἔπλασα καὶ ἐποίησα.
αὐτόν, καὶ ἐξήγαγον λαὸν τυφλόν, καὶ ὀφθαλμοί εἰσιν ὡσαύτως·
τυφλοί, καὶ κωφοὶ ὦτα ἔχοντες.
πάντα τὰ ἔθνη συνήχθησαν ἅμα, καὶ συναχθήσονται ἄρχοντες ἐξ αὐτῶν·
τίς ἀναγγελεῖ ταῦτα;
ἢ τὰ.
ἐξ ἀρχῆς τίς ἀναγγελεῖ ὑμῖν;
ἀγαγέτωσαν τοὺς μάρτυρας αὐτῶν καὶ δικαιωθήτωσαν, καὶ εἰπάτωσαν ἀληθῆ, καὶ ἀκουσάτωσαν.
γένεσθέμοι μάρτυρες, κἀγὼ μάρτυς, λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεός, καὶ ὁ παῖς ὃν·
ἐξελεξάμην, ἵνα γνῶτε καὶ πιστεύσητέ μοι, καὶ συνῆτε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι·
ἔμπροσθέν μου οὐκ ἐγένετο ἄλλος θεός, καὶ μετ’ ἐμὲ οὐκ ἔσται.
ἐγὼ ὁ θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν παρὲξ ἐμοῦ σώζων.
ἀνήγγειλα καὶ ἔσωσα, ὠνείδισα καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν ὑμῖν ἀλλότριος·
ὑμεῖς ἐμοὶ μάρτυρες, κἀγὼ μάρτυς, λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεός·
ἔτι ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς, καὶ οὒκ ἔστιν ὁ ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν μου ἐξαιρούμενος·
ποιήσω, καὶ τίς ἀποστρέψει αὐτό;
Ουτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὁ λυτρούμενος ὑμᾶς, ὁ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ Ἕνεκεν ὑμῶν ἀποστελῶ εἷς Βαβυλῶνα καὶ ἐπεγερῶ πάντας φεύγοντας, καὶ Χαλδαῖοι ἐν πλοίοις δεηθήσονται.
ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ θεὸς ὁ ἅγιος ὑμῶν, ὁ καταδείξας Ἰσραὴλ·
βασιλέα ὑμῶν.
οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ διδοὺς ὁδὸν ἐν θαλάσσῃ καὶ ἐν ὕδατι ἰσχυρῷ τρίβον, ὁ ἐξάγων ἅρματα καὶ ἵππον καὶ ὄχλον ἰσχυρόν·
ἀλλὰ ἐκοιμήθησαν καὶ οὐκ ἀναστήσονται, ἐσβέσθησαν ὡς λίνον ἐσβεσμένον.
Μὴ μνημονεύετε τὸ.
πρῶτα, καὶ τὸ, ἀρχαῖα μὴ συλλογίζεσθε·
ἰδοῦ ποιῶ καινὰἅ νῦν ἀνατελεῖ, καὶ γνώσεσθε αὐτά.
καὶ ποιήσω ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ὁδὸν καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀνύδρῳ ποταμούς·
εὐλογήσει με τὸ.
τοῦ ἀγροῦ, σειρῆνες καὶ θυγατέρες στρουθῶν, ὅτι ἔδωκα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ὕδωρ καὶ ποταμοὺς ἐν τῇ ἀνύδρῳ, ποτιῶ τὸ γένος μου τὸ ἐκλεκτόν, λαόν μου ὃν περιεποιησάμην τὰς ἀρετάς μου διηγεῖσθαι.
οὐ νῦν ἐκάλεσά σε, Ἰακώβ, οὔ κοπιᾶσαί σε ἐποίησα, Ἰσραήλ·
οὐκ ἐμοὶ πρόβατα τῆς ὁλοκαρπώσεώς σου, οὐδὲ ἐν ταῖς θυσίαις σου ἐδόξασάς με, οὐδὲ ἐδούλευσας ἐν ταῖς θυσίαις σου, οὐδὲ ἔγκοπον ἐποίησά σε ἐν λιβάνῳ, οὐδὲ ἐκτήσω μοι ἀργυρίου θυμίαμα, οὐδὲ στέαρ τῶν θυσιῶν σου ἐπεθύμησα, ἀλλὰ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις σου καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις σου προέστην σου.
ἐγώ εἰμι ἐγώ εἶμι ὁ ἐξαλείφων τὰς ἀνομίας σου, καὶ οὗ μὴ μνησθήσομαι τὰς ἀδικίας σου].
σὺ δὲ μνήσθητι καὶ κριθῶμεν·
λέγε σὺ τὰς ἀνομίας σου πρῶτος, ἵνα δικαιωθῇς.
οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν πρῶτοι καὶ οἶ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν ἠνόμησαν εἷς ἐμέ, καὶ ἐμίανανοἶ ἄρχοντες τὸ, ἅγιά μου·
καὶ ἔδωκα ἀπολέσω Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἶς ὀνειδισμόν.
Νῦν δὲ ἄκουσον, παῖς μου Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ὃν ἐξελεξάμην, οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὃ θεὸς ὃ ποιήσας σε, καὶ ὃ πλάσας σε ἐκ κοιλίας Ἔτι βοηθηθήσῃ·
μὴ φοβοῦ, παῖς μου Ἰακώβ, καὶ ὃ ἠγαπημένος Ἰσραὴλ ὃν ἐξελεξάμην.
ὅτι ἐγὼ δώσω ὕδωρ ἐν δίψει τοῖς πορευομένοις ἐν ἀνύδρῳ, ἐπιθήσω τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐπὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου, καὶ τὰς εὐλογίας μου ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα σου, καὶ ἀνατελοῦσιν ὡσεὶ χόρτος ἀνὰ.
μέσον ὕδατος, καὶ ὡς ἰτέα ἐπὶ παραρέον ὕδωρ.
οὗτος ἐρεῖ Τοῦ θεοῦ εἰμι, καὶ οὗτος ἐρεῖ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἕτερος ἐπιγράφει Τοῦ θεοῦ εἰμι, ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰσραήλ.
Οὕτως λέγει ὁ θεὸς ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ὁ ῥυσάμενος αὐτόν, θεὸς σαβαώθ Ἐγὼ πρῶτος καὶ ἐγὼ μετὰ ταῦτα, πλὴν ἐμοῦ οὐκ ἔστιν θεός·
τίς ὥσπερ ἐγώ;
στήτω, καλεσάτω, καὶ ἑτοιμασάτω μοι ἀφ’ οὗ ἐποίησα ἄνθρωπον εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ τὰ ἐπερχόμενα πρὸ τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἀναγγειλάτωσαν ὑμῖν.
μὴ παρακαλύπτεσθε·
οὐκ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς ἠνωτίσασθε, καὶ ἀπήγγειλα ὑμῖν;
μάρτυρες ὑμεῖς ἐστε εἰ ἔστιν θεὸς πλὴν ἐμοῦ·
καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν τότε.
οἱ πλάσσοντες καὶ γλύφοντες πάντες μάταιοι, οἱ ποιοῦντες τὰ καταθύμια αὐτῶν ἅ οὐκ ὠφελήσει αὐτούς·
ἀλλὰ αἰσχυνθήσονται.
πάντες οἱ πλάσσοντες θεὸν καὶ γλύφοντες ἀνωφελῆ, φελῆ, καὶ πάντες ὅθεν ἐγένοντο ἐξηράνθησαν, καὶ κωφοὶ ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων·
συναχθήτωσαν πάντες καὶ στήσονται ἅμα, ἐντραπήτωσαν καὶ αἰσχυνθήτωσαν ἅμα.
ὅτι ὤξυνεν τέκτων σίδηρον, σκεπάρνῳ εἰργάσατο αὐτὸ καὶ ἐν τερέτρῳ ἔτρησεν αὐτό, εἰργάσατο αὐτὸ ἐν τῷ βραχίονι τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ·
καὶ πεινάσει, καὶ ἀσθενήσει, καὶ οὗ μὴ πίῃ ὕδωρ.
ἐκλεξάμενος τέκτων ξύλον ἔστησεν αὐτὸ ἐν μέτρῳ, καὶ ἐν κόλλῃ ἐρύθμισεν, αὐτό, ἐποίησεν αὐτὸ ὡς μορφὴν ἀνδρὸς καὶ ὡς ὡραιότητα ἀνθρώπου, στῆσαι αὐτὸ ἐν οἴκῳ,[ ὃ] ἔκοψεν ξύλον ἐκ τοῦ δρυμοῦ, ὃ ἐφύτευσεν Κύριος, καὶ ὑετὸς ἐμήκυνεν, ἵνα ᾗ ἀνθρώποις εἷς καῦσιν·
καὶ λαβὼν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐθερμάνθη, καὶ καύσαντες ἔπεψαν ἄρτους ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ·
τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν εἰργάσατο εἷς θεούς, καὶ προσκυνοῦσιν αὐτούς.
οὗ τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ κατέκαυσεν ἐν πυρί, καὶ καύσαντες ἔπεψαν ἄρτους ἐπ’ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ κρέας ὀπτήσας ἔφαγεν καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη, καὶ θερμανθεὶς εἶπεν Ἡδύ μοι ὅτι ἐθερμάνθην καὶ ἴδον πῦρ.
τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν ἐποίησεν θεὸν γλυπτόν, καὶ προσκυνεῖ αὐτῷ καὶ προσεύχεται λέγων Ἐξελοῦ με, ὅτι θεός μου εἴ σύ.
οὐκ ἔγνωσαν φρονῆσαι, ὅτι ἀπημαυρώθησαν τοῦ βλέπειν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν καὶ τοῦ νοῆσαι τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν.
καὶ οὐκ ἐλογίσατο τῇ καρδίᾳ οὐδὲ ἀνελογίσατο ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ ἔγνω τῇ φρονήσει ὅτι τὸ ἥμισυ αὑτοῦ κατέκαυσεν ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἔπεψεν ἐπὶ τῶν ἀνθράκων αὐτοῦ ἄρτους, καὶ ὀπτήσας κρέας ἔφαγεν, καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν αὑτοῦ εἷς βδέλυγμα ἐποίησεν καὶ προσκυνοῦσιν αὐτῷ.
γνῶτε ὅτι σποδὸς ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν, καὶ πλανῶνται, καὶ οὐδεὶς δύναται ἐξελέσθαι τὴν ψυχὴν αὑτοῦ·
ἴδετε, οὐκ ἐρεῖτε ὅτι Ψεῦδος ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ μου.
Μνήσθητι ταῦτα, Ἰακὼβ καὶ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι παῖς μου εἶ σύ·
ἔπλασά σε παῖδά μου, καὶ σύ, Ἰσραήλ, μὴ ἐπιλανθάνου μου.
ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἀπήλειψα ὡς νεφέλην τὰς ἀνομίας σου, καὶ ὡς γνόφον τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου·
ἐπιστράφητι πρὸς μέ, καὶ λυτρώσομαί σε.
εὐφράνθητε, οὐρανοί, ὅτι ἠλέησεν ὃ θεὸς τὸν Ἰσραήλ·
σαλπίσατε, θεμέλια τῆς γῆς, βοήσατε ὅρη εὐφροσύνην, οἶ βουνοὶ καὶ πάντα τὰ ξύλα τὰ, ἐν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἠλέησεν ὃ θεὸς τὸν Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ δοξασθήσεται.
Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὃ λυτρώμενός σε καὶ πλάσσων σε ἐκ κοιλίας Ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ συντελῶν ταῦτα, ἐξέτεινα τὸν οὐρανὸν μόνος, καὶ ἐστερέωσα τὴν γῆν.
τίς ἕτερος διεσκέδασεν σημεῖα ἐγγαστριμύθων καὶ μαντίας ἀπὸ καρδίας, ἀποστρέφων φρονίμους εἷς τὰ ὀπίσω καὶ τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν μωρεύων, καὶ ἱστῶν ῥήματα παίδων αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν βουλὴν τῶν ἀγγέλων αὐτοῦ ἀληθεύων;
ὃ λέγων Ἰερουσαλήμ Κατοικηθήσῃ, καὶ ταῖς πόλεσιν τῆς Ἰουδαίας οἰκοδομηθήσεσθε, καὶ τὸ.
ἔρημα αὐτῆς ἀνατελεῖ·
ὁ λέγων τῇ ἀβύσσῳ Ἐρημωθησῃ, καὶ τοὺς ποταμούς σου ξηρανῶ·
ὁ λέγων Κύρῳ φρονεῖν, καὶ Πάντα τὰ θελήματά μου ποίησει·
ὁ λέγων Ἰερουσαλήμ Οἰκοδομηθήσῃ, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τὸν ἅγιόν μου θεμελιώσω.
Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὃ θεὸς τῷ χριστῷ μου Κύρῳ, οὗ ἐκράτησα τῆς δεξιᾶς, ἐπακοῦσαι ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ ἔθνη, καὶ ἰσχὺν βασιλέων διαρρήξω, ἀνοίξω ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ θύρας, καὶ πόλεις οὗ συγκλεισθήσονται Ἐγὼ ἔμπροσθεν αὑτοῦ πορεύσομαι καὶ ὅρη ὁμαλιῶ, θύρας χαλκᾶς συντρίψω καὶ μοχλοὺς σιδηροῦς συγκλάσω, καὶ δώσω σοι θησαυροὺς ἀποκρύφους, ἀποκρύφους,<ἀοράτους> ἀνοίζα σοι, ἵνα γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὃ θεὸς ὃ καλῶν τὸ ὄνομά σου, θεὸς Ἰσραήλ.
ἕνεκεν Ἰακὼβ τοῦ παιδός μου καὶ Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ ἐκλεκτοῦ μου ἐγὼ καλέσω σε τῷ ὀνόματί μου καὶ προσδέξομαί σε·
σὺ δὲ οὔκ ἔγνως με.
ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι πλὴν ἐμοῦ θεός·
καὶ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν με, ἵνα γνῶσιν οἶ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου καὶ οἶ ἀπὸ δυσμῶν ὅτι οὒκ ἔστιν πλὴν ἐμοῦ, καὶ ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὅ θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι, ἐγὼ ὃ κατασκευάσας φῶς καὶ ποιήσας σκότος, ὃ ποιῶν εἰρήνην καὶ κτίζων κακά·
ἐγὼ Κύριος ὅ θεὸς ὃ ποιῶν ταῦτα πάντα.
εὐφρανθήτω ὅ οὐρανὸς ἄνωθεν, καὶ αἱ νεφέλαι ῥαινέτωσαν δικαιοσύνην·
ἀνατειλάτω ἡ γῆ καὶ βλαστησάτω ἔλεος, καὶ δικαιοσύνη ἀνατειλάτω ἅμα·
ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὃ κτίσας σε.
Ποῖον βέλτιον κατεσκεύασα ὧς πηλὸν κεραμέως;
μὴ ὁ ἀροτριῶν ἀροτριάσει τὴν γῆν;
μὴ ἐρεῖ ὃ πηλὸς τῷ κεραμεῖ Τί ποιεῖς, ὅτι οὐκ ἐργάζῃ οὐδὲ ἔχεις χεῖρας;
ὁ λέγων τῷ πατρί Τί γεννήσεις;
καὶ τῇ μητρίΤί ὠδινήσεις;
ὅτι οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὅ θεὸς ὃ ἅγιος Ἰσραὴλ ὅ ποιήσας τὰ ἐπερχόμενα Ἑρωτήσατέ με περὶ τῶν υἱῶν μου καὶ περὶ τῶν θυγατέρων μου, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἔργων τῶν χειρῶν μου ἐντείλασθέ μοι.
ἐγὼ ἐποίησα γῆν καὶ ἄνθρωπον ἐπ’ αὐτῆς, ἐγὼ τῇ χειρί μου ἐστερέωσα τὸν οὐρανόν, ἐγὼ πᾶσι τοῖς ἄστροις ἐνετειλάμην.
ἐγὰ ἤγειρα αὑτὸν μετὰ δικαιοσύνης, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ὁδοὶ αὑτοῦ εὐθεῖαι·
αὐτὸς οἰκοδομήσει πόλιν μου, καὶ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ λαοῦ μου ἐπιστρέψει, οὗ μετὰ λύτρων οὐδὲ μετὰ, δώρων, εἶπεν Κύριος σαβαώθ.
Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος σαβαώθ Ἐκοπίασεν Αἴγυπτος, καὶ ἐμπορία Αἰθιόπων, καὶ οἱ Σεβωεὶμ ἄνδρες ὑψηλοὶ ἐπὶ σὲ διαβήσονται, καὶ σοὶ ἔσονται δοῦλοι καὶ ὀπίσω σου ἀκολουθήσουσιν δεδεμένοι χειροπέδαις, καὶ προσκυνήσουσίν σοι, καὶ ἐν σοὶ προσεύξονται·
ὅτι ἐν σοὶ ὃ θεός ἐστιν, καὶ ἐροῦσιν Οὐκ ἔστιν ὃ θεὸς πλὴν σοῦ.
σὺ γὰρ εἴ θεός, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδειμεν, ὁ θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ σωτήρ.
αἰσχυνθήσονται καὶ ἐντραπήσονται πάντες οἱ ἀντικείμενοι αὐτῷ.
καὶ πορεύσονται ἐν αἰσχύνῃ.
ἐγκαινίζεσθε πρὸς μέ, νῆσοι.
Ἰσραὴλ σώζεται ὑπὸ Κυρίου σωτηρίαν αἰώνων·
οὐκ αἰσχυνθήσονται οὐδὲ μὴ ἐντραπῶσιν ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος.
Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὅ ποιήσας τὸν οὐρανόν, οὗτος ὅ θεὸς ὅ καταδείξας τὴν γῆν καὶ ποιήσας αὐτήν, αὐτὸς διώρισεν αὑτήν, οὐκ εἷς κενὸν ἐποίησεν αὐτήν, ἀλλὰ κατοικεῖσθαι,Ἐγώ εἶμι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι.
οὐκ ἐν κρυφῇ λελάληκα οὐδὲ ἐν τόπῳ γῆς σκοτινῷ·
οὐκ εἶπα τῷ σπέρματι Ἰακώβ Μάταιον ζητήσατε·
ἐγώ εἰμι ἐγώ εἰμι λαλῶν δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἀναγγέλλων ἀλήθειαν.
συνάχθητε καὶ ἥκετε, βουλεύσασθε ἅμα, οἶ σωζόμενοι ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν.
οὑκ ἔγνωσαν οἱ αἴροντες τὸ ξύλον γλύμμα αὐτῶν, καὶ προσευχόμενοι ὡς πρὸς θεοὺς οἳ οὔ σώζουσιν·
εἰ ἀναγγέλλουσιν, ἐγγισάτωσαν, ἴνα γνῶμεν ἅμα τίς ἀκουστὰ ἐποίησεν ταῦτα ἀπ’ τότε ἀνηγγέλη ὑμῖν Ἐγὼ ὃ θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος πλὴν ἐμοῦ, δίκαιος καὶ σωτήρ, οὐκ ἔστιν παρὲξ ἐμοῦ.
ἐπιστράφητε πρός με καὶ σωθήσεσθε, οἶ ἀπ’ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς·
ἐγώ εἶμι ὃ θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος πλὴν ἐμοῦ, δίκαιος καὶ σωτήρ, οὐκ ἔστιν παρὲξ ἐμοῦ].
κατ’ ἐμαυτοῦ ὀμνύω, εἰ μὴν ἐξελεύσεται ἐκ τοῦ στόματός μου δικαιοσύνη, οἶ λόγοι μου οὐκ ἀποστραφήσονται, ὅτι ἐμοὶ κάμψει πᾶν γόνυ, καὶ ἐξομολογήσεται πᾶσα γλῶσσα τῷ θεῷ, λέγων Δικαιοσύνη καὶ δόξα πρὸς αὐτὸν ἥξουσιν, καὶ αἰσχυνθήσονται πάντες οἱ ἀφορίζοντες αὐτούς·
ἀπὸ Κυρίου δικαιωθήσονται, καὶ ἐν τῷ θεῷ ἐνδοξασθήσονται καὶ πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
Ἔπεσε Βήλ, συνετρίβη Δαγών, ἐγένετο τὰ.
γλυπτὰ αὐτῶν εἷς θηρία καὶ κτήνη·
αἴρετε αὐτὰ.
καταδεδεμένα ὡς φορτίον κοπιῶντι, καὶ πεινῶντι καὶ ἐκλελυμένῳ, οὐκ ἰσχύοντι ἅμα, οἳ οὐ μὴ δύνωνται σωθῆναι ἀπὸ πολέμου, αὐτοὶ δὲ αἰχμάλωτοι ἤχθησαν.
Ακούσατέ μου, οἶκος τοῦ Ἰακώβ, καὶ πᾶν τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, οἱ αἰρόμενοι ἐκ κοιλίας καὶ παιδευόμενοι ἀπὸ παιδίου·
ἕως γήρους ἐγώ εἶμι, καὶ ἕως ἂν καταγηράσητε ἐγώ εἰμι, ἐγὼ ἀνέχομαι ὑμῶν, ἐγὼ ἐποίησα καὶ ἐγὼ ἀνήσω, ἐγὼ ἀναλήμψομαι καὶ σώσω ὑμᾶς.
τίνι με ὡμοιώσατε;
ἴδετε, τεχνάσασθε, οἶ πλανώμενοι, σοῖ συμβαλλόμενοι χρυσίον ἐκ μαρσίππου καὶ ἀργύριον ἐν ζυγῷ στήσουσιν ἐν σταθμῷ καὶ μισθωσάμενοι χρυσοχόον ἐποίησαν χειροποίητα, καὶ κύψαντες προσκυνοῦσιν αὐτόν.
αἴρουσιν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων καὶ πορεύονται·
ἐὰν δὲ θῶσιν αὐτό, ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ μένει, οὐ μὴ κινηθῇ·
καὶ ὃς ἂν βοήσῃ πρὸς αὐτόν, οὗ μὴ ἀκούσῃ, ἀπὸ κακῶν οὗ μὴ σώσει αὐτόν.
Μνήσθητε ταῦτα καὶ στενάξατε, μετανοήσατε, οἱ πεπλανημένοι, ἐπιστρέψατε τῇ καρδίᾳ, καὶ μνήσθητε τὸ.
πρότερα ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος, ὅτι ἐγώ εἶμι ὅ θεὸς καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι πλὴν ἐμοῦ, ἀναγγέλλων πρότερον τὸ.
ἔσχατα πρὶν αὐτὸ.
γενέσθαι, καὶ ἅμα συνετελέσθη·
καὶ εἶπα Πᾶσά μου ἡ βουλὴ στήσεται, καὶ πάντα ὅσα βεβούλευμαι ποιήσω·
καλῶν ἀπ’ ἀνατολῶν πετεινὸν καὶ ἀπὸ γῆς πόρρωθεν περὶ ὦν βεβούλευμαι, ἐλάλησα καὶ ἤγαγον, ἔκτισα καὶ ἐποίησα, ἤγαγον αὐτὸν καὶ εὐόδωσα τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ.
ἀκούσατέ μου, οἱ ἀπολωλεκότες τὴν καρδίαν, οἱ μακρὰν ἀπὸ τῆς δικαιοσύνης.
ἥγγισα τὴν δικαιοσύνην μου, καὶ τὴν σωτηρίαν τὴν παρ’ ἐμοῦ οὗ βραδυνῶ·
δέδωκα ἐν Σιὼν σωτηρίαν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ εἷς δόξασμα.
Κατάβηθι, κάθισον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, παρθένος θυγάτηρ Βαβυλῶνος·
εἴσελθε εἷς τὸ σκότος, θυγάτηρ Χαλδαίων, ὅτι οὐκέτι προστεθήσῃ κληθῆναι ἁπαλὴ καὶ τρυφερά.
λάβε μύλον, ἄλεσον ἄλευρον, ἀποκάλυψαι τὸ κατακάλυμμά σου, ἀνακάλυψαι τὰς πολιάς, ἀνάσυραι τὰς κνήμας, διάβηθι ποταμούς.
ἀνακαλυφθήσεται ἡ αἰσχύνη χύνη σου, φανήσονται οἶ ὀνειδισμοί σου·
τὸ δίκαιον ἐκ σοῦ λήμψομαι, οὐκέτι μὴ παραδῶ ἀνθρώποις·
εἶπεν ὁ ῥυσάμενός σε Κύριος σαβαώθ, ὄνομα αὐτῷ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ.
κάθισον κατανενυγμένη, εἴσελθε εἷς τὸ σκότος, θυγάτηρ Χαλδαίων, οὐκέτι μὴ κληθήσῃ ἰσχὺς βασιλείας.
παρωξύνθην ἐπὶ τῷ λαῷ μου, ἐμίανας τὴν κληρονομίαν μου·
ἐγὼ ἔδωκα εἰς τὴν χεῖρά σου, σὺ δὲ οὐκ ἔδωκας αὐτοῖς ἔλεος, τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου ἐβάρυνας τὸν ζυγὸν σφόδρα, καὶ εἶπας Εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔσομαι ἄρχουσα.
οὐκ ἐνόησας ταῦτα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, οὐδὲ ἐμνήσθης τὸ.
ἔσχατα.
Νῦν δὲ ἄκουσον ταῦτα, ἡ τρυφερά, ἡ καθημένη, ἡ πεποιθυῖα, ἡ λέγουσα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆςἘγώ εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐτέρα, οὗ καθιῶ χήρα οὐδὲ γνώσομαι ὀρφανείαν.
νῦν δὲ ἥξει ἐξέφνης τὸ.
δύο ταῦτα ἐν μιᾷ χηρία καὶ ἀτεκνία, ἥξει ἐξέφνης ἐπὶ σέ ἐν τῇ φαρμακείᾳ σου, ἐν τῇ ἰσχύι.
τῶν ἐπαοιδῶν σου σφόδρα, τῇ ἐλπίδι τῆς πονηρίας σου·
σὺ γὰρ εἴπας Ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἑτέρα·
γνῶθι ὅτι ἢ σύνεσις τούτων καὶ ἦ πορνεία σου ἔσται σοι αἰσχύνη·
καὶ εἶπας τῇ καρδίᾳ σουἘγώ εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἑτέρα.
καὶ ἥξει ἐπὶ σὲ ἀπώλεια καὶ οὗ μὴ γνῷς, βόθυνος, καὶ ἐμπεσῇ εἰς αὐτόν·
καὶ ἥξει ἐπὶ σὲ ταλαιπωρία, καὶ οὐ μὴ δυνήσῃ καθαρὰ γενέσθαι·
καὶ ἥξει ἐπὶ σὲ ἐξέφνης ἀπώλεια καὶ οὐ μὴ γνῷς.
στῆθι νῦν ἐν ταῖς ἐπαοιδαῖς σου καὶ ἐν τῇ πολλῇ φαρμακείᾳ σου, εἳ ἐμάνθανες ἐκ νεότητός σου, εἰ δυνήσει ὠφεληθῆναι.
κεκοπίακας ἐν ταῖς βουλαῖς σου·
στήτωσαν καὶ σωσάτωσάν σε οἱ ἀστρολόγοι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, οἱ ὁρῶντες τοὺς ἀστέρας ἀναγγειλάτωσάν σοι τί μέλλει ἐπὶ σὲ ἔρχεσθαι.
ἰδοὺ πάντες ὡς φρύγανα ἐπὶ πυρὶ κατακαήσονται, καὶ·
οὐ μὴ ἐξέλωνται τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτῶν ἐκ φλογός·
ὅτι ἔχεις ἄνθρακας πυρός, κάθισαι ἐπ’ αὐτούς.
οὓτοι ἔσονταί σοι βοήθεια·
ἐκοπίασας ἐν τῇ μεταβολῇ σου ἐκ νεότητος, ἅνθρωπος καθ’ ἑαυτὸν ἐπλανήθη·
σοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἔσται σωτηρία.
Ἀκούσατε ταῦτα, οἶκος Ἰακώβ, οἱ κεκλημένοι τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰσραὴλ καὶ οἱ ἐξ Ἰούδα ἐξελθόντες, οἱ ὀμνύοντες τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, μιμνησκόμενοι οὗ μετὰ.
ἀληθείας οὐδὲ μετὰ δικαιοσύνης, καὶ ἀντεχόμενοι τῷ ὀνόματι τῆς πόλεως τῆς ἁγίας, καὶ ἐπὶ τῳ θεῷ του Ἰσραὴλ ἀντιστηριζόμενοι, Κύριος σαβαὼθ ὄνομα αὐτῷ.
τὰ πρότερα ἔτι ἀνήγγειλα, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ στόματός μου ἐξῆλθεν καὶ ἀκουστὰ ἐγένετο·
ἐξάπινα ἐποίησα, καὶ ἐπῆλθεν.
γινώσκω ἐγὼ ὅτι σκληρὸς εἶ, καὶ νεῦρον σιδηροῦν ὃ τράχηλός σου, καὶ τὸ μέτωπόν σου χαλκοῦν.
καὶ ἀνήγγειλά σοι τὸ.
πάλαι πρὶν ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ σέ·
ἀκουστόν σοι ἐποίησα, μὴ εἴπῃς ὅτι Τὸ.
εἴδωλά μοι ἐποίησαν, καὶ <μὴ εἴπῃς> Τὸ.
γλυπτὰ καὶ τὰ χωνευτὰ ἐνετείλατό μοι.
ἠκούσατε πάντα, καὶ ὑμεῖς οὐκ ἔγνωτε·
ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀκουστά σοι ἐποίησα τὸ, καινὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν ἃ μέλλει γίνεσθαι·
καὶ οὐκ εἶπας Νῦν γίνεται καὶ οὗ πάλαι, καὶ οὗ προτέραις ἡμέραις ἤκουσας αὐτά·
μὴ εἴπῃς ὅτι Ναί, γινώσκω αὐτά.
οὔτε ἔγνως οὔτε ἠπίστω, οὔτε ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς τὸ.
ὦτά σου·
ἔγνων γὰρ ὅτι ἀθετῶν ἀθετήσεις, καὶ ἄνομος ἔτι ἐκ κοιλίας κληθήσῃ.
ἕνεκεν τοῦ ἐμοῦ ὀνόματος δείξω σοι τὸν θυμόν μου, καὶ τὰ ἔνδοξά μου ἐπάξω ἐπὶ σοί, ἵνα μὴ ἐξολεθρεύσω σε.
ἰδοὺ πέπρακά σε οὐχ ἕνεκεν ἀργυρίου·
ἐξειλάμην δέ σε ἐκ καμίνου πτωχείας·
ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ ποιήσω σοι, ὅτι τὸ ἐμὸν ὄνομα βεβηλοῦται, καὶ τὴν δόξαν μου ἑτέρῳ οὗ δώσω.
Ἄκουέ μου, Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ὃν ἐγὼ καλῶ·
ἐγώ εἶμι πρῶτος, καὶ ἐγώ εἶμι εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ ἡ χείρ μου ἐθεμελίωσεν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἦ δεξιά μου ἐστερέωσεν τὸν οὐρανόν·
καλέσω αὐτούς, καὶ στήσονται ἅμα, καὶ συναχθήσονται πάντες καὶ ἀκούσονται.
τίς αὐτοῖς ἀνήγγειλεν ταῦτα;
ἀγαπῶν σε ἐποίησα ταῦτα ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα, τὸ θέλημά σου, τοῦ ἆραι σπέρμα Χαλδαίων·
ἐγὼ ἐλάλησα, ἐγὼ ἐκάλεσα, ἤγαγον αὐτὸν καὶ εὐόδωσα τήν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ.
προσαγάγετε πρὸς μὲ καὶ ἀκούσατε ταῦτα, οὐκ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς ἐν κρυφῇ ἐλάλησα, οὐδὲ ἐν τόπῳ γῆς σκοτινῷ·
ἡνίκα ἐγένετο, ἐκεῖ ἥμην, καὶ νῦν Κύριος ἀπέσταλκέν με, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα αὑτοῦ.
οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ ῥυσάμενός σε ὅ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ, Ἐγὼ εἰμι ὁ θεός σου> σοι τοῦ εὑρεῖν σε τὴν ὁδὸν ἐν ᾗ πορεύσῃ ἐν αὐτῇ.
καὶ εἶ ἤκουσας καὶ συναχθήσονται πάντες καὶ ἀκούσονται.
τίς αὐτοῖς τῶν ἐντολῶν μου, ἐγένετο ἂν ὡσεὶ ποταμὸς ἡ εἰρήνη σου, καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη σου ὡς κῦμα θαλάσσης.
καὶ ἐγένετο ἂν ὡσεὶ ἅμμος τὸ σπέρμα σου, καὶ τὸ, ἔκγονα τῆς κοιλίας σου ὥς ὁ χοῦς τῆς γῆν οὐδὲ νῦν οὔ μὴ ἐξολεθρευθῇς, οὐδὲ ἀπολεῖται τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐνώπιόν μου.
Ἔξελθε ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος φεύγων ἀπὸ τῶν Χαλδαίων·
εὐφροσύνης ἀναγγείλατε, καὶ ἀκουστὸν γενέσθω τοῦτο, ἀπαγγείλατε ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς, λέγετε Ἐρρύσατο Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ Ἰακώβ.
καὶ ἐὰν διψήσωσιν, δι’ ἐρήμου ἄξει αὐτούς, ὕδωρ ἐκ πέτρας ἐξάξει αὐτοῖς, σχισθήσεται πέτρα καὶ ῥυήσεται ὕδωρ, καὶ πίεται ὁ λαός μου.
οὐκ ἔστιν χαίρειν τοῖς ἀσεβέσιν, λέγει Κύριος.
Ἀκούσατέ μου, νῆσοι, καὶ προσέχετε, ἔθνη·
διὰ.
χρόνου πολλοῦ στήσεται, λέγει Κύριος.
ἐκ κοιλίας μητρός μου ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομά μου, καὶ ἔθηκεν τὸ στόμα μου ὡσεὶ μάχαιραν ὀξεῖαν, καὶ ὑπὸ τὴν σκέπην τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ ἔκρυψέν με·
ἔθηκέν με ὥς βέλος ἐκλεκτόν, καὶ ἐν τῇ φαρέτρα αὐτοῦ ἐσκέπασέν με, καὶ εἶπεν μοι Δοῦλός μου εἶ σύ, Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐν σοὶ δοξασθήσομαι.
καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπα Κενῶς ἐκοπίασα, καὶ εἷς μάταιον καὶ εἷς οὐθὲν ἔδωκα τὴν ἰσχύν μου·
διὰ τοῦτο ἡ κρίσις μου παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ ὃ πόνος μου ἐναντίον τοῦ θεοῦ μου.
καὶ νῦν οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὅ πλάσας με ἐκ κοιλίας δοῦλον ἑαυτῷ τοῦ συναγαγεῖν τὸν Ἰακὼβ καὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς αὐτόν Συναχθήσομαι καὶ δοξασθήσομαι ἐναντίον Κυρίου, καὶ ὅ θεός μου ἔσται μου ἰσχύς.
καὶ εἶπέν μοι Μέγα σοί ἐστιν τοῦ κληθῆναί σε παῖδά μου, τοῦ στῆσαι τὰς φυλὰς Ἰακὼβ καὶ τὴν διασπορὰν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπιστρέψαι·
ἰδοὺ τέθεικά σε εἷς φῶς ἐθνῶν, τοῦ εἷναί σε εἰς σωτηρίαν ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς.
οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὃ ῥυσάμενός σε ὅ θεὸς Ἰσραήλ Ἁγιάσατε τὸν φαυλίζοντα τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, τὸν βδελυσσόμενον ὑπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν δούλων τῶν ἀρχόντων·
βασιλεῖς ὄψονται αὐτόν, καὶ ἀναστήσονται ἄρχοντες καὶ προσκυνήσουσιν αὐτῷ ἕνεκεν Κυρίου·
ὅτι πιστός ἐστιν ὃ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐξελεξάμην σε.
οὕτως λέγει Κύριος Καιρῷ δεκτῷ ἐπήκουσά σου, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας ἐβοήθησά σοι, καὶ ἔδωκά σε εἰς διαθήκην ἐθνῶν, τοῦ καταστῆσαι τὴν γῆν καὶ κληρονομῆσαι κληρονομίαν ἐρήμου, λέγοντα τοῖς ἐν δεσμοῖς Ἐξέλθατε, καὶ τοῖς ἐν τῷ σκότει ἀνακαλυφθῆναι.
καὶ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν βοσκηθήσονται, καὶ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς τρίβοις ἡ νομὴ αὐτῶν.
οὑ πεινάσουσιν, οὐδὲ διψήσουσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ πατάξει αὐτοὺς καύσων οὐδὲ ὃ ἥλιος, ἀλλὰ ὁ ἐλεῶν αὐτοὺς παρακαλέσει, καὶ διὸ, πηγῶν ὑδάτων ἄξει αὐτούς·
καὶ θήσω πᾶν ὅρος εἷς ὁδὸν καὶ πᾶσαν τρίβον εἷς βόσκημα αὐτοῖς.
ἰδοὺ ἰδοὺ οὗτοι πόρρωθεν ἔρχονται, οὗτοι ἀπὸ βορρᾶ καὶ οὗτοι ἀπὸ θαλάσσης, ἄλλοι δὲ ἐκ γῆς Περσῶν.
εὐφραίνεσθε, οὐρανοί, καὶ ἀγαλλίσαθω ἦ γῆ, ῥηξάτωσαν τὰ ὅρη εὐφροσύνην, ὅτι ἠλέησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ταπεινοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ παρεκάλεσεν.
Εἶπεν δὲ Σιών Ἐγκατέλιπέν με Κύριος, καὶ ὃ θεὸς ἐπελάθετό μου.
μὴ μὴ ἐπιλήσεται μήτηρ τοῦ παιδίου αὐτῆς.
τοῦ μὴ ἐλεῆσαι τὸ, ἔκγονα τῆς κοιλίας αὐτῆς;
εἶ δὲ καὶ ἐπιλάθοιτο ταῦτα γυνή, ἀλλ’ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἐπιλήσομαι σοῦ, εἶπεν Κύριος.
ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ τῶν χειρῶν μου ἐζωγράφησά σου τὸ.
τείχη, καὶ ἐνώπιόν μου εἲ διὸ.
παντός, καὶ ταχὺ οἰκοδομηθήσῃ ὑφ’ὥν καθῃρέθης, καὶ οἱ ἐρη- μώσαντές σε ἐκ σοῦ ἐξελεύσονται.
ἆρον κύκλῳ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου καὶ ἴδε πάντες, ἰδοὺ συνήχθησαν καὶ ἤλθοσαν πρὸς σέ·
ζῶ ἐγώ, λέγει Κύριος, ὅτι πάντας αὐτοὺς ἐνδύσῃ, καὶ περιθήσῃ αὐτοὺς ὡς κόσμον νύμφης.
ὅτι τὸ.
ἔρημά σου καὶ τὰ διεφθαρμένα καὶ τὸ.
πεπτωκότα, νῦν στενοχωρήσει ἀπὸ τῶν ἐνοικούντων, καὶ μακρυνθήσονται ἀπὸ σοῦ οἱ καταπίνοντές σε.
ἐροῦσιν γὰρ εἷς τὰ ὦτά σου οἶ υἱοί σου οὕς ἀπολώλεκας Στενός μοι ὅ τόπος, ποίησόν μοι τόπον ἵνα κατοικήσω.
καὶ ἐρεῖς ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου Τίς ἐγέννησέν μοι τούτους;
ἐγὼ δὲ ἄτεκνος καὶ χήρα, τούτους δὲ τίς ἐξέθρεψέν μοι;
ἐγὼ δὲ κατελείφθην μόνη, οὗτοι δέ μοι ποῦ ἦσαν;
Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος Ἰδοὺ αἴρω εἷς τὸ.
ἔθνη τὴν χεῖρά μου, καὶ εἷς τὰς νήσους ἀρῶ σύνσημόν μου, καὶ ἄξουσιν τοὺς υἱούς σου ἐν κόλπῳ, τὰς δὲ θυγατέρας σου ἐπ’ ὤμων ἀροῦσιν, καὶ ἔσονται βασιλεῖς τιθηνοί σου, αἶ δὲ ἄρχουσαι τροφοί σου·
ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς προσκυνήσουσίν σοι, καὶ τὸν χοῦν τῶν ποδῶν σου λίξουσιν·
καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ αἰσχυνθήσῃ.
Μὴ λήμψεταί τις παρὰ.
γίγαντος σκῦλα;
καὶ ἐὰν αἰχμαλωτεύσῃ τις ἀδίκως, σωθήσεται;
οὕτως λέγει Κύριος Ἐάν τις αἰχμαλωτεύσῃ γίγαντα, λήμψεται σκῦλα·
λαμβάνων δὲ παρὰ ἰσχύοντος σωθήσεται·
ἐγὼ δὲ τὴν κρίσιν σου κρινῶ, καὶ ἐγὼ τοὺς υἱούς σου ῥύσομαι.
καὶ φάγονται οἱ θλίβοντές σε τὰς σάρκας αὐτῶν, καὶ πίονται αἷς οἶνον νέον τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν καὶ μεθυ- σθήσονται, καὶ αἰσθανθήσεται πᾶσα σὰρξ ὅτι ἐγὼ ὃ ῥυσάμενός σε καὶ ἀντιλαμβανόμενος ἰσχύος Ἰακώβ.
Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος Ποῖον τὸ βιβλίον τοῦ ἀποστασίου τῆς μητρὸς ὑμῶν,ᾦ ἐξαπέστειλα αὐτήν;
ἢ τίνι ὑπόχρεῳ πέπρακα ὑμᾶς;
ἰδοὺ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν ἐπράθητε, καὶ ταῖς ἀνομίαις ὑμῶν ἐξαπέστειλα τὴν μητέρα ὑμῶν.
τί ὅτι ἦλθον, καὶ οὒκ ἦν ἅνθρωπος;
ἐκάλεσα, καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσεν;
μὴ οὐκ ἰσχύει ἡ χείρ μου τοῦ ῥύσασθαι;
ἢ οὐκ ἰσχύω τοῦ ἐξελέσθαι;
ἰδοὺ τῇ ἀπειλῇ μου ἐξερημώσω τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ θήσω ποταμοὺς ἐρήμους, καὶ ξηρανθήσονται οἱ ἰχθύες αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ὕδωρ, καὶ ἀποθανοῦνται ἐν δίψει.
καὶ ἐνδύσω τὸν οὐρανὸν σκότος, καὶ θήσω ὥς σάκκον τὸ περιβόλαιον αὑτοῦ.
Κύριος δίδωσίν μοι γλῶσσαν σοφίας τοῦ γνῶναι ἐν καιρῷ ἡνίκα δεῖ εἰπεῖν λόγον·
ἔθηκέν μοι τὸ πρωί, προσέθηκέν μοι ὠτίον ἀκούειν, καὶ ἡ παιδία Κυρίου ἀνοίγει τὰ ὦτά μου, ἐγὼ δὲ οὐκ ἀπειθῶ οὐδὲ ἀντιλέγω.
τὸν νῶτόν μου δέδωκα εἰς μάστιγας, τὰς δὲ σιαγόνας μου εἰς ῥαπίσματα, τὸ δὲ πρόσωπόν μου οὐκ ἀπέστρεψα ἀπὸ αἰσχύνης ἐμπτυσμάτων, καὶ Κύριος βοηθός μου ἐγενήθη·
διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἐνετράπην, ἀλλὰ ἔθηκα τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ὥς στερεὰν πέτραν, καὶ ἔγνων ὅτι οὐ μὴ αἰσχυνθῶ.
ὅτι ἐγγίζει ὃ δικαιώσας με·
τίς ὃ κρινόμενός μοι;
ἀντιστήτω μοι ἅμα·
καὶ τίς ὃ κρινόμενός μοι;
ἐγγισάτω μοι.
ἰδοὺ Κύριος βοηθεῖ μοι·
τίς κακώσει με;
ἰδοὺ πάντες ὑμεῖς ὦς ἱμάτιον παλαιωθήσεσθε, καὶ ὡς σὴς καταφάγεται ὑμᾶς.
Τίς ἐν ὑμῖν ὃ φοβούμενος τὸν κύριον;
ἀκουσάτω τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ παιδὸς αὑτοῦ·
οἱ πορευόμενοι ἐν σκότει, οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς φῶς, πεποίθατε ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου καὶ ἀντστηρίσασθε ἐπὶ τῷ θεῷ.
ἰδοὺ ἰδοὺ πάντες ὑμεῖς πῦρ καίετε καὶ κατισχδύετε φλόγα·
πορεύεσθε τῷ φωτὶ τοῦ πυρὸς ὑμῶν καὶ τῇ φλογὶ ᾗ ἐξεκαύσατε·
δι’ ἐμὲ ἐγένετο ταῦτα ὑμῖν, ἐν λύπῃ κοιμηθήσεσθε.
Ἀκούσατέ μου, οἶ διώκοντες τὸ δίκαιον καὶ ζητοῦντες τὸν κύριον, ἐμβλέψατε εἷς τὴν στερεὰν πέτραν ἥν ἐλατομήσατε, καὶ εἷς τὸν βόθυνον τοῦ λάκκου ὃν ὠρύξατε.
ἐμβλέψατε εἷς Ἀβραὰμ τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν, καὶ εἷς Σάρραν τὴν ὠδίνουσαν ὑμᾶς·
ὅτι εἷς ἦν καὶ ἐκάλεσα αὐτόν, καὶ ηὐλόγησα αὐτὸν καὶ ἠγάπησα αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπλήθυνα αὐτόν.
καὶ σὲ νῦν παρακαλέσω, Σιών, καὶ παρεκάλεσα πάντα τὰ ἔρημα αὐτῆς, <καὶ θήσω τὸ.
ἔρημα αὐτῆς ὡς παράδεισον, καὶ πρὸς δυσμὰς) ὥς παράδεισον Κυρίου·
εὐφροσύνην καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα εὑρήσουσιν ἐν αὐτῇ, ἐξομολόγησιν καὶ φωνὴν αἰνέσεως.
Ἀκούσατέ μου, ἀκούσατε, λαός μου, καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς πρὸς μὲ ἐνωτίσασθε, ὅτι νόμος παρ’ ἐμοῦ ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ ἦ κρίσις μου εἷς φῶς ἐθνῶν.
ἐγγίζει ταχὺ ἡ δικαιοσύνη μου, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται τὸ σωτήριόν μου, καὶ εἷς τὸν βραχίονά μου ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν·
ἐμὲ νῆσοι ὑπομενοῦσιν, καὶ εἷς τὸν βραχίονά μου ἐλπιοῦσιν.
ἅρατε εἷς τὸν οὐρανὸν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐμβλέψατε εἷς τὴν γῆν κάτω, ὅτι ὃ οὐρανὸς ὥς καπνὸς ἐστερεώθη, καὶ ἡ γῆ ὥς ἱμάτιον παλαιωθήσεται, οἶ δὲ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν ὥσπερ ταῦτα ἀποθανοῦνται, τὸ δὲ σωτήριόν μου εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔσται, ἡ δὲ δικαιοσύνη μου οὗ μὴ ἐκλίπῃ.
Ἀκούσατέ μου, οἱ εἰδότες κρίσιν, λαός μου οὗ ὁ νόμος μου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν, μὴ φοβεῖσθε ὀνειδισμὸν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ τῷ φαυλισμῷ αὐτῶν μὴ ἡττᾶσθε.
ὥσπερ γὰρ ἱμάτιον βρωθήσεται ὑπὸ χρόνου, καὶ ὥσπερ ἔρια βρωθήσεται ὑπὸ σητός, ἦ δὲ δικαιοσύνη μου εἶς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔσται, τὸ δὲ σωτήριόν μου εἷς γενεὰς γενεῶν.
Ἑξεγείρου ἐξεγείρου Ἰερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔνδυσαι τὴν ἰσχὺν τοῦ βραχίονός σου·
ἐξεγείρου ὡς ἐν ἀρχῇ ἡμέρας, αἷς γενεὰ αἰῶνος.
οὗ σὺ εἴ ἡ ἐρημοῦσα θάλασσαν, ὕδωρ ἀβύσσου πλῆθος;
ἦ θεῖσα τὰ βάθη τῆς θαλάσσης ὁδὸν διαβάσεως ῥυομένοις καὶ λελυτρωμένοις;
ὑπὸ γὰρ Κυρίου ἀποστραφήσονται, καὶ ἥξουσιν εἷς Σιὼν μετ’ εὐφροσύνης καὶ ἀγαλλιάματος αἰωνίου·
ἐπὶ γὰρ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν ἀγαλ- λίαμα καὶ αἴνεσις, καὶ εὐφροσύνη καταλήμψεται αὐτούς, ἀπέδρα ὀδύνη καὶ λύπη καὶ στεναγμός.
ἐγώ εἶμι ἐγώ εἶμι ὃ παρακαλῶν σε·
γνῶθι τίνα εὐλαβηθεῖσα ἐφοβήθης ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου θνητοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ υἱοῦ ἀνθρώπου, οἳ ὡσεὶ χόρτος ἐξηράνθησαν.
καὶ ἐπελάθου θεὸν τὸν ποιήσαντά σε, τὸν ποιήσαντα τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ θεμελιώ- σαντα τὴν γῆν·
καὶ ἐφόβου ἀεὶ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ θυμοῦ θλίβοντός σε, ὃν τρόπον γὰρ ἐβουλεύσατο τοῦ ἀραί σε·
καὶ νῦν ποῦ ὃ θυμὸς τοῦ θλίβοντός σε;
ἐν γὰρ τῷ σώζεσθαί σε οὔ στήσεται οὐδὲ χρονιεῖ·
ὅτι ἐγὼ ὃ θεός σου ὃ ταράσσων τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ ἠχῶν τὸ.
κύματα αὐτῆς, Κύριος σαβαὼθ ὄνομά μοι.
θήσω τοὺς λόγους μου εἰς τὸ στόμα σου, καὶ ὑπὸ τὴν δεξιάν μου σκεπάσω σε, ἐν ᾗ ἔστησα τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ ἐθεμελίωσα τὴν γῆν·
καὶ ἐρεῖ Σιών Λαός μου εἴ σύ.
Ἐξεγείρου ἐξεγείρου, Ἰερουσαλήμ, ἡ πιοῦσα τὸ ποτήριον τοῦ θυμοῦ ἐκ χειρὸς Κυρίου·
τὸ ποτήριον γὰρ τῆς πτώσεως, τὸ κόνδυ τοῦ θυμοῦ, ἔπιες καὶ ἐξεκένωσας, καὶ οὒκ ἦν ὁ παρακαλῶν σε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων σου ὦν ἔτεκες, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὃ ἀντιλαμβανόμενος τῆς χειρός σου οὑδὲ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν υἱῶν σου ὧν ὗψωσας.
δύο ταῦτα ἀντικείμενά σοι·
τίς σοι συλλυπηθήσεται;
πτῶμα καὶ σύντριμμα, λιμὸς καὶ μάχαιρα·
τίς σε παρακαλέσει;
οἱ υἱοί σοι οἱ ἀπορούμενοι, οἱ καθεύδοντες ἐπ’ ἄκρου πάσης ἐξόδου ὡς σευτλίον ἡμίεφθον, οἱ πλήρεις θυμοῦ Κυρίου, ἐκλελυμένα διὰ Κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ.
διὰ τοῦτο ἄκουε, τεταπεινωμένη καὶ μεθύουσα οὐκ ἀπὸ οἴνου.
οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὃ θεὸς ὅ κρίνων τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ Ἰδοὺ εἴληφα ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου τὸ ποτήριον τῆς πτώσεως, τὸ κόνδυ τοῦ θυμοῦ, καὶ οὕ προσθήσῃ ἔτι πιεῖν αὐτό·
καὶ ἐμβαλῶ αὐτὸ εἷς τὰς χεῖρας τῶν ἀδικησάντων σε καὶ τῶν ταπεινωσάντων σε, οἳ εἶπαν τῇ ψυχῇ σου Κύψον, ἴνα παρέλθωμεν·
καὶ ἔθηκας ἴσα τῇ γῇ τὸ.
μετάφρενά σου ἔξω τοῖς παραπορευομένας.
Ἐξεγείρου ἐξεγείρου, Σιών·
ἔνδυσαι τὴν ἰσχύν σου, Σιών, καὶ ἔνδυσαι τὴν δόξαν σου, Ἰερουσαλήμ, πόλις ἁγία·
οὐκέτι προστεθήσεται διελθεῖν διὸ, σοῦ ἀπερίτμητος καὶ ἀκάθαρτος.
ἐκτίναξαι τὸν χοῦν καὶ ἀνάστηθι, κάθισον, Ἰερουσαλήμ·
ἔκδυσαι τὸν δεσμὸν τοῦ τραχήλου σου, ἦ αἰχμάλωτος θυγάτηρ Σιών.
ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος δωρεὰν ἐπράθητε, καὶ οὒ μετὰ ἀργυρίου λυτρωθήσεσθε.
Οὖτως λέγει Κύριος Εἰς Αἴγυππον κατέβη ὃ λαός μου τὸ πρότερον παροικῆσαι ἐκεῖ, καὶ εἷς Ἀσσυρίους ἤχθησαν·
καὶ νῦν τί ὧδε ἔσται;
τάδε λέγει Κύριος Ὅτι ἐλήμφθη ὃ λαός μου θαυμάζετε καὶ ὀλολύζετε.
τάδε λέγει Κύριος Δι’ ὑμᾶς διὰ παντὸς τὸ ὄνομά μου βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν.
διὰ τοῦτο γνώσεται ὃ λαός μου τὸ ὄνομά μου έν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ.
ἐκείνῃ, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι αὑτὸς ὃ λαλῶν·
πάρειμι ὡς ὥρα ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων, ὡς πόδες εὐαγγελιζομένου ἀκοὴν εἰρήνης, ὡς εὐαγγελιζόμενος ἀγαθά, ὅτι ἀκουστὴν ποιήσω τὴν σωτηρίαν σου λέγων Σιών Βασιλεύσει σου ὃ θεός·
ὅτι φωνὴ τῶν φυλασσόντωνσε ὑψώθη, καὶ τῇ φωνῇ ἅμα εὐφρανθήσονται·
ὅτι ὀφθαλμοὶ πρὸς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὄψονται, ἡνίκα ἂν ἐλεήσῃ Κύριος τὴν Σιών.
ῥηξάτω εὐφροσύνην ἅμα τὸ.
ἔρημα Ἰερουσαλήμ, ὅτι ἠλέησεν·
Κύριος αὐτὴν καὶ ἐρρύσατο Ἰερουσαλήμ.
καὶ ἀποκαλύψει Κύριος τὸν βραχίονα αὐτοῦ τὸν ἅγιον ἐνώπιον πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ ὄψονται πάντα τὰ ἄκρα τῆς γῆς τὴν σωτηρίαν τὴν παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ.
Ἀπόστητε ἀπόστητε, ἐξέλθατε ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ ἀκαθάρτου μὴ ἅπτεσθε, ἐξέλ- θατε ἐκ μέσου αὐτῆς, ἀφορίσθητε, οἱ φέροντες τὸ.
σκεύη Κυρίου·
ὅτι οὗ μετὰ.
ταραχῆς ἐξελεύσεσθε οὐδὲ πορεύσεσθε, πορεύσεται γὰρ πρότερος ὑμῶν Κύριος καὶ ὁ ἐπισυνάγων ὑμᾶς Κύριος ὅ θεὸς Ἰσραήλ.
Ἰδοὺ συνήσει ὃ παῖς μου, καὶ ὑψωθήσεται καὶ δοξασθήσεται σφόδρα.
ὅν τρόπον ἐκστήσονται ἐπὶ σὲ πολλοί, οὕτως ἀδοξήσει ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων τὸ εἶδός σου, καὶ ἡ δόξα σου ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων.
οὕτως θαυμάσονται ἔθνη πολλὰ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, καὶ συνάξουσιν βασιλεῖς τὸ στόμα αὐτῶν·
ὅτι οἷς οὐκ ἀνηγγέλη περὶ αὐτοῦ ὄψονται, καὶ οἳ.
οὐκ ἀκηκόασιν συνήσουσιν.
Kύριε, τίς ἐπίστευσεν τῇ ἀκοῇ ἡμῶν;
καὶ ὃ Κυρίου τίνι ἀπεκαλύφθη;
ἀνηγγείλαμεν ἐναντίον αὑτοῦ ὡς παιδίον, ὡς ῥίζα ἐν γῇ διψώσῃ·
οὐκ ἔστιν εἶδος αὐτῷ οὐδὲ δόξα.
καὶ ἴδομεν·
αὐτόν, καὶ οὒκ εἶχεν εἶδος οὐδὲ κάλλος, ἀλλὰ τὸ εἶδος αὐτοῦ·
ἄτιμον, ἐκλεῖπον παρὰ πάντας ἀνθρώπους·
ἅνθρωπος ἐν πληγῇ·
ὢν καὶ εἰδὼς φέρειν μαλακίαν, ὅτι ἀπέστραπται τὸ πρόσωπον·
αὑτοῦ, ἠτιμάσθη καὶ οὐκ ἐλογίσθη.
οὗτος τὰς ἁμαρτίας φέρει καὶ περὶ ἡμῶν ὀδυνᾶται, καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐλογισάμεθα αὐτὸν εἶναι ἐν πόνῳ καὶ ἐν πληγῇ καὶ ἐν κακώσει.
αὐτὸς δὲ ἐτραυματίσθη διὰ τὰς ἀνομίας ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐμαλακίσθη διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας παιδία εἰρήνης ἡμῶν ἐπ’ αὐτόν, τῷ μώλωπι αὑτοῦ ἡμεῖς ἰάθημεν.
πάντες ὡς πρόβατα ἐπλανήθημεν, ἅνθρωπος Τῇ ὁδῷ αὐτοῦ ἐπλανήθη·
καὶ Κύριος παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ἡμῶν.
καὶ αὐτὸς διὰ τὸ κεκακῶσθαι οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα·
ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη, καὶ ὡς ἀμνὸς ἐναντίον τοῦ κείραντος αὐτὸν ἄφωνος, οὕτως οὔκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα αὑτοῦ.
ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει ἦ κρίσις αὐτοῦ τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται;
ὅτι αἴρεται ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἡ ζωὴ αὐτοῦ, ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνομιῶν τοῦ λαοῦ μου ἤχθη εἰς θάνατον.
καὶ δώσω τοὺς καὶ αὐτὸς διὰ τὸ πονηροὺς ἀντὶ τῆς ταφῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς πλουσίους ἀντὶ τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ·
ὅτι ἀνομίαν οὐκ ἐποίησεν, οὐδὲ εὑρέθη δόλος ἐν τῷ στόματι αὑτοῦ.
καὶ Κύριος βούλεται καθαρίσαι αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς πληγῆς·
ἐὰν δῶτε περὶ ἁμαρτίας, ἡ ὑμῶν ὄψεται σπέρμα μακρόβιον·
καὶ βούλεται Κύριος ἀφελεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ πόνου τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ, δεῖξαι αὐτῷ φῶς καὶ πλάσαι τῇ συνέσει, δικαιῶσαι δίκαιον εὖ δουλεύοντα πολλοῖς, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν αὑτὸς ἀνοίσει.
διὰ τοῦτο αὐτὸς κληρονομήσει πολλούς, καὶ τῶν ἰσχυρῶν μεριεῖ σκῦλα·
ἀνθ’ ὧν παρεδόθη εἷς θάνατον ἡ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀνόμοις ἐλογίσθη, καὶ αὐτὸς ἁμαρτίας πολλῶν ἀνήνεγκεν, καὶ διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν παρεδόθη.
Εὐφράθητι, στεῖρα ἡ οὐ τίκτουσα, ῥῆξον καὶ βόησον, ἡ οὐκ ὠδίνουσα, ὅτι πολλὰ τὰ τέκνα τῆς ἐρήμου μᾶλλον ἢ τῆς ἐχούσης τὸν ἄνδρα·
εἶπεν γὰρ Κύριος.
πλάτυνον τὸν τόπον τῆς σκηνῆς σου καὶ τῶν αὐλαιῶν σου, πῆξον, μὴ φείσῃ, μάκρυνον τὸ.
σχοινίσματά σου, καὶ τοὺς πασσάλους σου κατίσχυσον, ἔτι εἷς δεξιὰ καὶ εἷς τὸ, ἀριστερὰ, ἐκπέτασον·
καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου ἔθνη κληρονομήσει, καὶ πόλεις ἠρημωμένας κατοικήσεις.
μὴ φοβοῦ, ὅτι κατῃσχύνθης, μηδὲ ἐντραπῇς, ὅτι ὠνειδίσθης, ὅτι αἰσχύνην αἰωνίον ἐπιλήσῃ, καὶ ὄνειδος τῆς χηρίας σου οὐ μὴ μνησθήσῃ.
ὅτι Κύριος ὁ ποιῶν σε, Κύριος σαβαὼθ ὄνομα αὐτῷ·
καὶ ὁ ῥυσάμενός σε, θεὸς αὐτὸς Ἰσραήλ, πάσῃ τῇ γῇ κληθήσεται.
οὐχ ὡς γυναῖκα καταλε- λειμμένην <καὶ ὀλιγόψυχον> κέκληκέν σε Κύριος, οὐδ’ ὡς γυναῖκα ἐκ νεότητος μεμισημένην·
εἶπεν ὁ θεός σου.
χρόνον μικρὸν κατέλιπόν σε, καὶ μετὰ ἐλέους μεγάλου ἐλεήσω σε·
ἐν θυμῷ μικρῷ ἀπέστρεψα τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἐν ἐλέει αἰωνίῳ ἠλέησά σε·
εἶπεν ὃ ῥυσάμενός σε Κύριος.
ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ ἐπὶ Νῶε τοῦτό μοί ἐστιν, καθότι ὤμοσα αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ ἐκείνῳ, τῇ γῇ μὴ θυμωθήσεσθαι ἐπὶ σοὶ ἔτι, μηδὲ ἐν ἀπειλῇ σου τὰ ὅρη μεταστήσασθαι, οὐδὲ οἱ βουνοί σου μετακινηθήσονται·
οὕτως οὐδὲ τὸ παρ’ ἐμοῦ σοι ἔλεος ἐκλείψει, οὐδὲ ἡ διαθήκη τῆς εἰρήνης σου οὔ μὴ μεταστῇ·
εἶπεν γὰρ Κύριος ἵλεώς σοι.
Ταπεινὴ καὶ ἀκατάστατος οὗ παρεκλήθης·
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἑτοιμάζω σοι ἄνθρακα τὸν λίθον σου, καὶ τὸ.
θεμέλιά σου σάπφειρον, καὶ θήσω τὰς ἐπάλξεις σου ἴασπιν, καὶ τὰς πύλας σου λίθους κρυστάλλου, καὶ τὸν περίβολόν σου λίθους ἐκλεκτούς, καὶ πάντας τοὺς υἱούς σου διδακτοὺς θεοῦ, ἐν πολλῇ εἰρήνῃ τὰ τέκνα σου.
καὶ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ οἰκοδομηκαὶ θήσῃ·
ἀπέχου ἀπὸ ἀδίκου, καὶ οὐ φοβηθήσῃ, καὶ τρόμος οὐκ ἐγγιεῖ σοι.
ἰδοὺ ἰδοὺ προσήλυτοι προσελεύσονταί σοι δι’ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ σὲ καταφεύξονται.
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ κτίζω σε, οὐχ ὡς χαλκεὺς φυσῶν ἄνθρακας καὶ ἐκφέρων σκεῦος εἰς ἔργον·
ἐγὼ δὲ ἔκτισά σε, οὐκ εἰς ἀπώλειαν φθεῖραι.
πᾶν σκεῦος φθαρτόν, ἐπὶ δὲ σὲ οὐκ εὐδοκήσω·
καὶ πᾶσα φωνὴ ἥ ἀναστήσεται ἐπὶ σὲ εἰς κρίσιν, πάντας αὐτοὺς ἡττήσεις, οἱ δὲ ἔνοχοί σου ἔσονται ἐν αὐτῇ.
ἔστιν κληρονομία τοῖς θεραπεύουσιν Κυρίῳ, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθέ μοι δίκαιοι, λέγει Κύριος.
Οἱ διψῶντες, πορεύεσθε ἐφ’ ὕδωρ, καὶ ὅσοι μὴ ἔχετε ἀργύριον, βαδίσαντες ἀγοράσατε, καὶ πίετε ἄνευ ἀργυρίου καὶ τιμῆς οἴνου καὶ στέαρ.
ἵνα τί τιμᾶσθε ἀργυρίου, καὶ τὸν μόχθον ὑμῶν οὐκ εἷς πλησμονήν;
ἀκούσατέ μοι, καὶ φάγεσθε ἀγαθά, καὶ ἐντρυφήσει ἒν ἀγαθοῖς ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν.
προσέχετε τοῖς ὠτίοις ὑμῶν καὶ ἐπακολουθήσατε ταῖς ὁδοῖς μου·
ἐπακούσατέ μου, καὶ ζήσεται ἐν ἀγαθοῖς ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν, καὶ διαθήσομαι ὑμῖν διαθήκην αἰώνιον, τὰ ὅσια Δαυεὶδ τὰ πιστά.
ἰδοὺ μαρτύριον ἐν ἔθνεσιν δέδωκα αὐτόν, ἄρχοντα καὶ προστάσσοντα ἔθνεσιν.
ἔθνη ἅ οὐκ ᾔδεισάν σε ἐπικαλέσονταί σε, καὶ λαοὶ οἳ οὐκ ἐπίστανταί σε ἐπὶ σὲ καταφεύξονται, ἕνεκεν τοῦ θεοῦ σου τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἐδόξασέν σε.
Ζητήσατε τὸν θεόν, καὶ ἐν τῷ εὑρίσκειν αὐτὸν ἐπικαλέσασθε·
ἡνίκα ἂν ἐγγίζῃ ὐγῖν, ἀπολιπέτα ὁ ἀσεβὴς τὰς ὁδοὺς αὑτοῦ καὶ ἀνὴρ ἄνομος τὰς βουλὰς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπιστραφήτω ἐπὶ Κύριον, καὶ ἐλεηθήσεται, ὅτι ἐπὶ πολὺ ἀφήσει τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν.
οὐ γάρ εἶσιν αἱ βουλαί μου ὥσπερ αἱ βουλαὶ ὑμῶν, οὐδὲ ὥσπερ αἱ ὁδοὶ ὑμῶν αἱ ὁδοί μου, λέγει Κύριος·
ἀλλ᾿ ὡς ἀπέχει ὁ οὐρανὸς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, οὕτως ἀπέχει ἡ ὁδός μου ἀπὸ τῶν ὁδῶν ὑμῶν καὶ τὸ, διανοήματα ὑμῶν ἀπὸ τῆς διανοίας μου.
ὡς γὰρ ἐὰν καταβῇ ὑετὸς ἢ χιὼν ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ οὗ μὴ ἀποστραφῆ ἕως ἂν μεθύσῃ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἐκτέκῃ, καὶ βλαστήσει, καὶ δώσει σπέρμα τῷ σπείροντι καὶ ἅρτον εἷς βρῶσιν·
οὕτως ἔσται τὸ ῥῆμά μου ὃ ἐὰν ἐξέλθῃ ἐκ τοῦ στόματός μου, οὐ μὴ ἀποστραφῇ ἕως ἂν συντελεσθῇ ὅσα ἠθέλησα, καὶ εὐοδώσω τὰς ὁδούς σου καὶ τὰ ἐντάλματά μου.
ἐν γὰρ εὐφροσύνῃ ἐξελεύσεσθε καὶ ἐν χαρᾷ διδαχθήσεσθε·
τὰ γὰρ ὅρη καὶ οἱ βουνοὶ ἐξαλοῦνται προσδεχόμενοι ὑμᾶς ἐν χαρᾷ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ξύλα τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐπικροτήσει τοῖς κλάδοις, καὶ ἀντὶ τῆς στοιβῆς ἀναβήσεται κυπάρισσος, ἀντὶ δὲ τῆς κονύζης ἀναβήσεται μυρσίνη·
καὶ ἔσται Κύριος εἷς ὄνομα καὶ εἷς σημεῖον αἰώνιον, καὶ οὔκ ἐκλείψει.
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Φυλάσσεσθε κρίσιν, ποιήσατε δικαιοσύνην·
ἤγγισεν γὰρ τὸ σωτήριόν μου παραγίνεσθαι, καὶ τὸ ἔλεός μου ἀποκαλυφθῆναι.
μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὁ ποιῶν ταῦτα, καὶ ἅνθρωποςὃ ἀντεχόμενος αὐτῶν, καὶ φυλάσσων τὰ σάββατα μὴ βεβηλοῦν, καὶ διατηρῶν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ μὴ ποιεῖν ἀδίκημα.
μὴ λεγέτω ὁ ἀλλογενὴς ὃ προσκείμενος πρὸς Κύριον Ἀφοριεῖ με ἄρα Κύριος ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ·
καὶ μὴ λεγέτω ὃ εὐνοῦχος ὅτι Ἐγώ εἰμι ξύλον ξηρόν.
τάδε λέγει Κύριος τοῖς εὐνούχοις ὅσοι ἂν φυλάξωνται τὰ σάββατά μου καὶ ἐκλέξωνται ἅ ἐγὼ θέλω καὶ ἀντέχωνται τῆς διαθήκης μου, δώσω αὐτοῖς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου καὶ ἐν τῷ τείχει μου τόπον ὀνομαστόν, κρείσσων υἱῶν καὶ θυγατέρων, ὄνομα αἰώνιον δώσω αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἐκλείψει.
καὶ τοῖς ἀλλογενέσιν τοῖς προσκειμένοις πρὸς Κύριον δουλέυειν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀγαπᾶν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, τοῦ εἶναι αὐτῷ εἷς δούλους καὶ δούλας, καὶ πάντας τοὺς φυλασσομένους τὰ σάββατά μου μὴ βεβηλοῦν, καὶ ἀντεχομένους τῆς διαθήκης μου, εἰσάξω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ ὅρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου, καὶ εὐφρανῶ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τῆς προσευχῆς μου·
τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ θυσίαι αὐτῶν ἔσονται δεκταὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου μου.
ὁ γὰρ οἶκός μου οἶκος προσευχῆς κληθήσεται πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, εἶπεν Κύριος ὃ συνάγων τοὺς διεσπαρμένους Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι συνάξω ἐπ’ αὐτὸν συναγωγήν.
Πάντα τὰ θηρία τὰ ἄγρια, δεῦτε φάγετε, πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ δρυμοῦ.
ἴδετε ἴδετε ὅτι πάντες ἐκτετύφλωνται, οὐκ ἔγνωσαν φρονῆσαι, πάντες κύνες ἐνεοί, οὕ δυνήσονται ὑλακτεῖν, ἐνυπνιαζόμενοι κοίτην, φιλοῦντες νυστάξαι.
καὶ οἱ κύνες ἀναιδεῖς τῇ ψυχῇ, οὐκ εἰδότες πλησμονήν·
καί εἰσιν πονηροὶ οὐκ εἰδότες σύνεσιν, πάντες ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν ἐξηκολούθησαν, ἕκαστος κατὰ τὸ αὑτό.
Ἴδετε ὡς ὅ δίκαιος ἀπώλετο, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐκδέχεται τή καρδίᾳ, καὶ ἄνδρες δίκαιοι αἴρονται, καὶ οὐδεὶς κατανοεῖ.
ἀπὸ γὰρ προσώπου ἀδικίας ἦρται ὃ δίκαιον ἔσται ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἡ ταφὴ αὐτοῦ, ἦρται ἐκ τοῦ μέσου.
ὑμεῖς δὲ προσαγάγετε ὧδε, υἱοὶ ἄνομοι, σπέρμα μοιχῶν καὶ πόρνης·
ἐν τίνι ἐνετρυφήσατε;
καὶ ἐπὶ τίνα ἠνοίξατε τὸ στόμα ὑμῶν;
καὶ ἐπὶ τίνα ἐχαλάσατε τὴν γλῶσσαν ὑμῶν;
οὐχ ὑμεῖς ἐστε τέκνα ἀπωλείας, σπέρμα ἄνομον;
οἱ παρακαλοῦντες τὸ.
εἴδωλα ὑπὸ δένδρα δασέα, σφάζοντες τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ἐν ταῖς φάραγξιν ἀνὰ.
μέσον τῶν πετρῶν.
ἐκείνη σου ἡ μερίς, οὗτός σου ὁ κλῆρος, κἀκείνοις ἐξέχεας σπονδὰς κἀκείνοις ἀνήνεγκας θυσίας·
ἐπὶ τούτοις οὖν οὐκ ὀργισθήσομαι;
ἐπ’ ὅρος ὑψηλὸν καὶ μετέωρον, ἐκεῖ σου ἡ κοίτη, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀνεβίβασας θυσίας·
καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν σταθμῶν τῆς θύρας σου ἔθηκας μνημόσυνά σου·
ᾤου ὅτι ἐὰν ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ ἀποστῇς, πλεῖόν τι ἔξεις·
ἠγάπησας τοὺς κοιμωμένους μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ἐπλήθυνας τὴν πορνείαν σου μετ’ αὐτῶν, καὶ πολλοὺς ἐποίησας τοὺς μακρὰν ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἀπέστειλας πρέσβεις ὑπὲρ τὸ.
ὅριά σου, καὶ ἀπέστρεψας, καὶ ἐταπεινώθης ἕως ᾄδου.
ταῖς πολυοδίαις σου ἐκοπίασας, καὶ οὐκ εἶπας Παύσομαι, ἐνισχύουσα ἔπραξας ταῦτα, διὰ τοῦτο οὔ κατεδεήθης μου σύ.
τίνα εὐλαβηθεῖσα ἐφοβήθης, καὶ ἐψεύσω με καὶ οὐκ ἐμνήσθης μου, οὐδὲ ἔλαβές με εἷς τὴν διάνοιαν οὐδὲ εἷς τὴν καρδίαν σου;
κἀγώ σε ἰδὼν παρορῶ, καὶ ἐμὲ οὐκ ἐφοβήθης.
κἀγὼ ἀπαγγελῶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην μου καὶ τὸ.
κακά σου,ἂ οὐκ ὠφελήσουσίν σε·
ὅταν ἀναβοήσῃς, ἐξελέσθωσάν σε ἓν τῇ θλίψει σου·
τούτους γὰρ πάντας ἄνεμος λήμψεται.
καὶ ἀποίσει καταιγίς.
οἶ δὲ ἀντεχόμενοί μου κτήσονται γῆν, καὶ κληρονομήσουσιν τὸ ὅρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου, καὶ ἐροῦσιν Καθαρίσατε ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ὁδούς, καὶ ἄρατε σκῶλα ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ τοῦ λαοῦ μοῦ.
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὃ ὕψιστος, ὁ ἐν ὑψηλοῖς κατοικῶν τὸν αἰῶνα, Ἅγιος ἐν ἁγίοις ὄνομα αὐτῷ, Κύριος, ὕψιστος ἐν ἁγίοις ἀναπαυόμενος, καὶ ὀλιγοψύχοις διδοὺς μακροθυμίαν, καὶ διδοὺς ζωὴν τοῖς συντετριμμένοις τὴν καρδίαν·
καὶ οὐκ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἐκδικήσω ὑμᾶς, οὐδὲ διὰ παντὸς ὀργισθήσομαι ὑμῖν·
πνεῦμα γὰρ παρ’ ἐμοῦ ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ πνοὴν πᾶσαν ἐγὼ ἐποίησα.
δια ἁμαρτίαν τι ἐλύπησα αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπάταξα αὐτὸν καὶ ἀπέστρεψα τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἐλυπήθη, καὶ ἐπορεύθη στυγνὸς ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ.
τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ ἑώρακα, καὶ ἰασάμην αὐτὸν καὶ παρεκάλεσα αὐτόν, καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτῷ παράκλησιν ἀληθινήν, εἰρήνην ἐπ’ εἰρήνην τοῖς μακρὰν καὶ τοῖς ἐγγὺς οὖσιν.
καὶ εἶπεν Κύριος Ἰάσομαι αὐτούς·
οἱ δὲ ἄδικοι οὕτως κλυδωνισθήσονται, καὶ ἀναπαύσασθαι οὐ δυνήσονται.
οὐκ ἔστιν χαίρειν τοῖς ἀσεβέσιν, εἶπεν Κύριος ὃ θεός.
Ἀναβόησον ἐν ἰσχύι καὶ μὴ φείσῃ, ὡς σάλπιγγα ὕψωσον τὴν φωνήν σου, καὶ ἀνάγγειλον τῷ λαῷ μου τὰ ἁμαρτήματα αὐτῶν, καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακὼβ τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν.
ἐμὲ ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας ζητήσουσιν, καὶ γνῶναί μου τὰς ὁδοὺς ἐπιθυμοῦσιν, ὡς λαὸς δικαιοσύνην θεοῦ πεποιηκὼς καὶ κρίσιν θεοῦ αὐτοῦ μὴ ἐγκαταλελοιπώς·
αἰτοῦσίν με νῦν κρίσιν δικαίαν, καὶ ἐγγίζειν θεῷ ἐπιθυμοῦσιν, λέγοντες Τί ὅτι ἐνηστεύσαμεν καὶ οὐκ εἶδες;
ἐταπεινώσαμεν τὰς ψυχὰς ἡμῶν καὶ οὐ προσέσχες;
ἐν γὰρ ταῖς ἡμέραις τῶν νηστειῶν ὑμῶν εὑρίσκετε τὰ θελήματα ὑμῶν, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ὑποχειρίους ὑμῶν ὑπονύσσετε.
εἰς κρίσεις καὶ μάχας νηστεύετε καὶ τύπτετε πυγμαῖς ταπεινόν, ἵνα τί μοι νηστεύετε ὡς σήμερον, ἀκουσθῆναι ἐν κραυγῇ τὴν φωνὴν ὑμῶν;
οὐ ταύτην τὴν νηστείαν ἐξελεξάμην, καὶ ἡμέραν ταπεινοῦν ἄνθρωπον τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ·
οὐδ᾿ ἂν κάμψῃς ὡς κρίκον τὸν τράχηλόν σου, καὶ σάκκον καὶ σποδὸν ὑποστρώσῃ, οὐδ᾿ οὕτως καλέσετε νηστείαν δεκτήν.
οὐχὶ τοιαύτην νηστείαν ἐγὼ ἐξελεξάμην, λέγει Κύριος, ἀλλὰ λῦε πάντα σύνδεσμον ἀδικίας, διάλυε στραγγαλιὰς βιαίων συναλλαγμάτων, ἀπόστελλε τεθραυσμένους ἐν ἀφέσει, καὶ πᾶσαν συγγραφὴν ἄδικον διάσπα.
διάθρυπτε πεινῶντι τὸν ἄρτον σου, καὶ πτωχοὺς ἀστέγους εἴσαγε εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου·
ἐὰν ἴδῃς γυμνόν, περίβαλε, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν οἰκείων τοῦ σπέρματός σου οὐχ ὑπερόψῃ.
τότε ῥαγήσεται πρόιμον τὸ φῶς σου, καὶ τὰ.
ἰάματά σου ταχὺ ἀνατελεῖ, καὶ προπορεύσεται ἔμπροσθέν σου ἡ δικαιοσύνη σου, καὶ ἡ δόξα τοῦ θεοῦ περιστελεῖ σε·
τότε βοήσῃ, καὶ ὁ θεὸς εἰσακούσεταί σου, ἔτι λαλοῦντός σου ἐρεῖ Ἰδοὺ πάρειμι.
ἐὰν ἀφέλῃς ἀπὸ σοῦ σύνδεσμον καὶ χειροτονίαν καὶ γογγυσμοῦ, καὶ δῷς πεινῶντι τὸν ἄρτον σου ἐκ ψυχῆς σου, καὶ ψυχὴν τεταπεινωμένην ἐμπλήσῃς, τότε ἀνατελεῖ ἐν τῷ σκότει τὸ φῶς σου, καὶ τὸ σκότος σου ὡς μεσημβρία, καὶ ἔσται ὁ θεός σου <μετὰ σοῦ> διὸ.
παντός·
καὶ ἐμπλησθήσῃ καθάπερ ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ ψυχή σου, καὶ τὸ.
ὀστᾶ.
σου πιανθήσεται, καὶ ἔσται ὡς κῆπος μεθύων καὶ ὡς πηγὴ ἢν μὴ ἐξέλιπεν ὕδωρ·
καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ σου ὡς βοτάνη ἀνατελεῖ καὶ πιανθήσεται, καὶ κληρονομήσουσι γενεὰς γενεῶν.
καὶ οἰκοδομηθήσονταί σου αἱ ἔρημοι αἰώνιοι, καὶ ἔσται σου τὰ θεμέλια αἰώνια γενεῶν γενεαῖς·
καὶ κληθήσῃ Οἰκοδόμος φραγμῶν, καὶ τοὺς τρίβους τοὺς ἀνὰ μέσον παύσεις.
ἐὰν ἀποστρέψῃς τὸν πόδα σου ἀπὸ τῶν σαββάτων, τοῦ μὴ ποιεῖν τὸ, θελήματά σου ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἁγίᾳ.
καὶ καλέσεις τὸ.
σάββατα τρυφερά, ἅγια τῷ θεῷ σου, οὐκ ἀρεῖς τὸν πόδα σου ἐπ’ ἔργω, οὐδὲ λαλήσεις λόγον ἐν ὀργῇ ἐκ τοῦ στόματός σου, καὶ ἔσῃ πεποιθὼς ἐπὶ Κύριον, καὶ ἀναβιβάσει σε ἐπὶ τὰ ἀγαθὰ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ψωμιεῖ σε τὴν κληρονομίαν Ἰακὼβ τοῦ πατρός σου·
τὸ γὰρ στόμα Κυρίου ἐλάλησεν ταῦτα.
Mὴ οὐκ ἰσχύει ἦ χεὶρ Κυρίου τοῦ σῶσαι;
ἢ ἐβάρυνεν τὸ οὖς αὐτοῦ τοῦ μὴ εἰσακοῦσαι;
ἀλλὰ τὸ.
ἁμαρτήματα ὑμῶν διιστῶσιν ἀνὰ, μέσον ὑμῶν <καὶ ἀνὰ, μέσον τοῦ θεοῦ θεοῦ>, τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν ἀπέστρεψεν τὸ πρόσωπον αὑτοῦ ἀφ’ ὑμῶν τοῦ μὴ ἐλεῆσαι.
αἱ γὰρ χεῖρες ὑμῶν μεμολυμμέναι αἵματι, καὶ οἷ δάκτυλοι ὑμῶν ἐν ἁμαρτίαις, τὰ δὲ χείλη ὑμῶν ἐλάλησεν ἀνομίαν, καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα ὑμῶν ἀδικίαν μελετᾷ.
οὐδεὶς λαλεῖ δίκαια, οὐδὲ ἔστιν κρίσις ἀληθινή·
πεποίθασιν ἐπὶ ματαίοις καὶ λαλοῦσιν κενά, ὅτι κύουσιν πόνον καὶ τίκτουσιν ἀνομίαν.
ὠὰ ἀσπίδων ἔρρηξαν, καὶ ἱστὸν ἀράχνης ὑφαίνουσιν, καὶ ὃ μέλλων τῶν ὠῶν αὐτῶν φαγεῖν, συντρίψας οὔριον εὗρεν, καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ βασιλίσκος.
ὁ ἰστὸς αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔσται εἷς ἱμάτιον, οὐδὲ μὴ περιβάλωνται ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῶν·
τὰ γὰρ ἔργα αὐτῶν ἔργα ἀνομίας.
οἱ δὲ πόδες αὐτῶν ἐπὶ πονηρίαν τρέχουσιν, ταχινοὶ ἐκχέαι αἷμα, καὶ οἶ διαλογισμοὶ αὐτῶν διαλογισμοὶ ἀφρόνων·
σύντριμμα καὶ ταλαιπωρία ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ὁδὸν εἰρήνης οὐκ ἔγνωσαν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν κρίσις ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν·
αἱ γὰρ τρίβοι αὐτῶν διεστραμμέναι ἅς διοδεύουσιν, καὶ οὒκ οἴδασιν εἰρήνην.
διὰ τοῦτο ἀπέστη ἦ κρίσις ἀπ’ αὐτῶν, καὶ οὗ μὴ καταλάβῃ αὐτοὺς δικαιοσύνη·
ὑπομεινάντων <αὐτῶν> φῶς αὐτοῖς σκότος, μείναντες αὐγὴν ἐν ἀωρίᾳ περιεπάτησαν.
ψηλαφήσουσιν ὡς τυφλοὶ τοῖχον, καὶ ὡς οὐχ ὑπαρχόντων ὀφθαλμῶν ψηλαφήσουσιν, καὶ πεσοῦνται ἐν μεσημβρίᾳ ὡς ἐν μεσονυκτίῳ, ὡς ἀποθνήσκοντες στενάξουσιν, ὡς ἄρκος καὶ ὡς περιστερὰ ἅμα πορεύσονται·
ἀνεμείναμεν κρίσιν καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν·
σωτηρία μακρὰν ἀφέστηκεν ἀφ’ ἡμῶν.
πολλὴ γὰρ ἡμῶν ἡ ἀνομία ἐναντίον σου, καὶ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ἡμῶν ἀντέστησαν ἡμῖν·
αἱ γὰρ ἀνομίαι ἡμῶν ἐν ἡμῖν, καὶ τὸ.
ἀδικήματα ἡμῶν ἔγνωμεν·
ἠσεβήσαμεν καὶ ἐψευσάμεθα, καὶ ἀπέστημεν ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν τοῦ θεοῦ ἐλαλήσαμεν ἄδικα καὶ ἠπειθήσαμεν, ἐκύομεν καὶ ἐμελετήσαμεν ἀπὸ καρδίας ἡμῶν λόγους ἀδίκους, καὶ ἀπεστήσαμεν ὀπίσω τὴν κρίσιν, καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη μακρὰν ἀφέστηκεν ἀφ’ ὅτι καταναλώθη ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν ἡ ἀλήθεια, καὶ δι’ εὐθείας οὐκ ἐδύναντο διελθεῖν.
καὶ ἡ ἀληθεία ἦρται, καὶ μετέστησαν τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν τοῦ συνιέναι·
καὶ εἶδεν Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ ἤρεσεν αὐτῷ, ὅτι οὐκ ἦν κρίσις.
καὶ ἴδεν καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀνήρ, καὶ κατενόησεν καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀντιλημψόμενος, καὶ ἠμύνατο αὐτοὺς τῷ βραχίονι αὐτοῦ καὶ τῇ ἐλεημοσύνη ἐστηρίσατο.
καὶ ἐνεδύσατο δικαιοσύνην ὡς θώρακα, καὶ περιέθετο περικεφαλαίαν σωτηρίου ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς, καὶ περιεβάλετο ἱμάτιον ἐκδικήσεως, καὶ τὸ περιβόλαιον ὡς ἀνταποδώσων ἀνταπόδοσιν ὄνειδος τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις.
καὶ φοβηθήσονται οἱ ἀπὸ δυσμῶν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου τὰ ὄνομα το ἔνδοξον·
ἥξει γὰρ ὡς ποταμὸς βίαιος ἡ ὀργὴ παρὰ.
Κυρίου, ἥξει μετὰ θυμοῦ.
καὶ ἥξει ἕνεκεν Σιὼν ὁ ῥυόμενος, καὶ ἀποστρέψει ἀσεβείας ἀπὸ Ἰακώβ.
καὶ αὕτη αὐτοῖς ἡ παρ’ ἐμοῦ διαθήκη, εἶπεν Κύριος·
τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἐμὸν ὅ ἐστιν ἐπὶ σοί, καὶ τὰ ῥήματα ἅ ἔδωκα εἷς τὸ στόμα σου, οὐ μὴ ἐκλίπῃ ἐκ τοῦ στόματός σου καὶ ἐκ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ σπέρματός σου·
εἶπεν Κύριος ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ εἷς τὸν αἰῶνα.
φωτίζου φωτίζον, Ἰερουσαλήμ, ἥκει γάρ σου τὸ φῶς, καὶ ἡ δόξα Κυρίου ἐπὶ σὲ ἀνατέταλκεν.
ἰδοὺ σκότος καὶ γνόφος καλύπτει γῆν ἐπ’ ἔθνη·
ἐπὶ σὲ φανήσεται Κύριος, καὶ ἡ δόξα αὑτοῦ ἐπὶ σὲ ὀφθήσεται·
καὶ πορεύσονται βασιλεῖς τῷ φωτί σου, καὶ ἔθνη τῇ λαμπρότητί σου.
ἆρον κύκλῳ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου καὶ ἴδε συνηγμένα τὰ.
τέκνα σου·
ἰδοὺ ἥκασιν πάντες οἱ υἱοί σου μακρόθεν, καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες σου ἐπ’ ὤμων ἀρθήσονται.
τότε ὄψῃ, καὶ φοβηθήσῃ, καὶ ἐκστήσῃ τῇ καρδίᾳ, ὅτι μεταβαλεῖ εἷς σέ πλοῦτος θαλάσσης καὶ ἐθνῶν καὶ λαῶν.
καὶ ἥξουσίν σοι ἀγέλαι καμήλων, καὶ καλύψουσίν σε κάμηλοι Μαδιάμ καὶ Γαιφάρ·
πάντες ἐκ Σαβὰ ἥξουσιν φέροντες χρυσίον, καὶ λίβανον οἴσουσιν καὶ λίθον τίμιον, καὶ τὸ σωτήριον Κυρίου εὐαγγελιοῦνται·
καὶ πάντα τὰ πρόβατα Κηδὰρ συναχθήσονται, καὶ οἱ κριοὶ Ναβαιὼθ ἥξουσίν σοι, καὶ ἀνενεχθήσονται δεκτὰ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον μου, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τῆς προσευχῆς μου δοξασθήσεται, τίνες οἵδε ὡς νεφέλαι πέτανται, καὶ ὡς περιστεραὶ συν νεοσσοῖς;
ἐμὲ νῆσοι ὑπέμειναν, καὶ πλοῖα Θαρσεὶς ἐν πρώτοις, ἀγαγεῖν τὰ τέκνα σου μακρόθεν καὶ τὸν ἄργυρον καὶ τὸν χρυσὸν μετ' αὐτῶν, διὰ τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου τὸ ἅγιον, καὶ διὰ τὸ τὸν ἅγιον τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἔνδοξον εἶναι.
καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιν ἀλλογενεῖς τὰ τείχη σου, καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν παραστήσονταί σου·
διὰ γάρ ὀργήν μου ἐπάταξα σε, καὶ διὰ ἕλεος ἠγάπησά σε.
καὶ ἀνοιχθήσονται αἱ πύλαι σου διὰ παντός, ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς οὐ κλεισθήσονται, εἰσαγαγεῖν πρὸς σὲ δύναμιν ἐθνῶν καὶ βασιλεῖς ἀγομένους.
τὰ γὰρ ἔθνη καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς, οἵτινες οὐ δουλεύσουσίνσοι ἀποθανοῦνται, καὶ τὰ ἔθνη ἐρημίᾳ ἐρημωθήσονται.
καὶ ἡ δόξα τοῦ Λιβάνου πρὸς σὲ ἥξει ἐν κυπαρίσσῳ καὶ πεύκῃ καὶ κέδρῳ ἅμα, δοξάσαι τὸν τόπον τὸν ἅγιόν μου.
καὶ πορεύσονται πρὸς σὲ δεδοικότες υἱοὶ ταπεινωσάντων σε καὶ παροξυνάντων σε, καὶ κληθήσῃ Πόλις κυρίου Σιων ἁγίου Ισραηλ.
διὰ τὸ γεγενῆσθαί σε ἐγκαταλελειμμένην καὶ μεμισημένην καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ βοηθῶν·
καὶ θήσω σε ἀγαλλίαμα αἰώνιον, εὐφροσύνην γενεῶν γενεαῖς.
καὶ θηλάσεις γάλα ἐθνῶν καὶ πλοῦτον βασιλέων φάγεσαι·
καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ κύριος ὁ σῴζων σε καὶ ἐξαιρούμενός σε θεὸς Ισραηλ.
καὶ ἀντὶ χαλκοῦ οἴσω σοι χρυσίον, ἀντὶ δὲ σιδήρου οἴσω σοι ἀργύριον, ἀντὶ δὲ ξύλου οἴσω σοι χαλκόν, ἀντὶ δὲ λίθων σίδηρον.
καὶ δώσω τοὺς ἄρχοντάς σου ἐν εἰρήνῃ, καὶ τοὺς ἐπισκόπους σου ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ·
καὶ οὐκ ἀκουσθήσεται ἔτι ἀδικία ἐν τῇ γῇ σου, οὐδὲ σύντριμμα οὐδὲ ταλαιπωρία ἐν τοῖς ὁρίοις σου, ἀλλὰ κληθήσεται Σωτήριον τὰ τείχη σου, καὶ αἱ πύλαι σου Γλύμμα.
καὶ οὐκ ἔσται σοι ὁ ἥλιος εἷς φῶς ἡμέρας, οὐδὲ ἀνατολὴ σελήνης φωτιεῖ σοι τὴν νύκτα, ἀλλ’ ἔσται σοι Κύριος φῶς αἰώνων, καὶ ὃ θεὸς δόξα σου.
οὐ γὰρ δύσεται ὅ ἥλιός σου, καὶ ἡ σελήνη σοι οὐκ ἐκλείψει·
ἔσται γὰρ Κύριός σοι φῶς αἰώνιον, καὶ ἀναπληρωθήσονται αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ πένθους σου.
καὶ ὅ λαός σου πᾶς δίκαιος, καὶ διὰ αἰῶνος κληρονομήσουσιν τὴν γῆν, φυλάσσων τὸ φύτευμα, ἔργα χειρῶν αὑτοῦ εἰς δόξαν.
ὁ ὀλιγοστὸς ἔσται εἷς χιλιάδας, καὶ ὅ ἐλάχιστος εἷς ἔθνος μέγα·
ἐγὼ Κύριος κατὰ καιρὸν συνάξω αὐτούς.
Πνεῦμα Κυρίου ἐπ’ ἐμέ, οὗ εἵνεκεν ἔχρισέν με εὐαγγελίσασθαι πτωχοῖς, ἀπέσταλκέν με ἰάσασθαι τοὺς συντετριμμένους τῇ καρδία, κηρῦξαι αἰχμαλώτοις ἄφεσιν καὶ τυφλοῖς ἀνάβλεψιν, καλέσαι ἐνιαυτὸν Κυρίου δεκτὸν καὶ ἡμέραν ἀνταποδόσεως, παρακαλέσαι πάντας τοὺς πενθοῦντας, δοθῆναι τοῖς πενθοῦσιν Σιὼν δόξαν ἀντὶ σποδοῦ, ἄλειμμα εὐφροσύνης τοῖς πενθοῦσιν, καταστολὴν δόξης ἀντὶ πνεύματος ἀκηδίας·
καὶ κληθήσονται γενεαὶ δικαιοσύνης, φύτευμα Κυρίου εἶς δόξαν.
καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιν ἐρήμους αἰωνίας.
ἐξερημωμένας προτέρας ἐξαναστήσουσιν·
καὶ καινιοῦσιν πόλεις ἐρήμους, ἐξερημωμένας εἷς γενεάς.
καὶ ἥξουσιν ἀλλογενεῖς ποιμαίνοντες τὸ.
πρόβατά σου, καὶ ἀλλόφυλοι ἀροτῆρες καὶ ἀμπελουργοί·
ὑμεῖς δὲ ἱερεῖς Κυρίου κληθήσεσθε, καὶ λειτουργοὶ θεοῦ·
ἰσχὺν ἐθνῶν κατέδεσθε καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ πλούτῳ αὐτῶν θαυμασθήσεσθε.
οὕτως ἐκ δευτέρας κληρονομήσουσιν τὴν γῆν, καὶ εὐφροσύνη αἰώνιος ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς αὑτῶν.
ἐγὼ γάρ εἶμι Κύριος ὃ ἀγαπῶν δικαιοσύνην καὶ μισῶν ἁρπάγματα ἐξ ἀδικίας·
καὶ δώσω τὸν μόχθον αὐτῶν δικαίοις, καὶ διαθήκην αἰώνιον διαθήσομαι αὐτοῖς.
καὶ γνωσθήσεται έν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ, ἔκγονα αὐτῶν·
πᾶς ὁ ὁρῶν αὐτοὺς ἐπιγνώσεται αὐτούς, ὅτι οὗτοί εἰσιν σπέρμα ηὐλογημένον ὑπὸ θεοῦ, καὶ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ εὐφρανθήσονται ἐπὶ Κύριον.
Ἀγαλλιάσθω ἦ ψυχή μου ἐπὶ τῷ κυρίῳ·
ἐνέδυσεν γάρ με ἱμάτιον σωτηρίου καὶ χιτῶνα εὐφροσύνης, ὡς νυμφίῳ περιέθηκέν μοι μίτραν, καὶ ὡς νύμφην κατεκόσμησέν με κόσμῳ.
καὶ ὡς γῆν αὔξουσαν τὸ ἄνθος αὐτῆς, καὶ ὡς κῆπον τὰ σπέρματα αὐτοῦ, οὕτως ἀνατελεῖ Κύριος δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα ἐναντίον πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν.
Διὰ Σιὼν οὐ σιωπήσομαι, καὶ διὰ Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἀνήσω, ἕως ἂν ἐξέλθῃ ὡς φῶς ἡ δικαιοσύνη μου, τὸ δὲ σωτήριόν μου ὡς λαμπὰς καυθήσεται.
καὶ ὄψονται ἔθνη τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου καὶ βασιλεῖς τὴν δόξαν σου, καὶ καλέσει σε τὸ ὄνομά σου τὸ καινὸν ὃ ὃ κύριος ὀνομάσει αὐτό.
καὶ ἔσῃ στέφανος κάλλους ἐν χειρὶ Κυρίου, καὶ διάδημα βασιλείας ἐν χειρὶ θεοῦ σου.
καὶ οὐκέτι κληθήσῃ Καταλελιμμένη, καὶ ἡ γῆ σου οὐ κληθήσεται Ἔρημος·
σοὶ γὰρ κληθήσεται Θέλημα ἐμόν, καὶ τῇ γῇ σου Οἰκουμένη.
καὶ ὡς συνοικῶν νεανίσκος παρθένῳ, οὕτως κατοικήσουσιν οἱ υἱοί σου μετὰ.
σοῦ·
καὶ ἔσται ὃν τρόπον εὐφρανθήσεται νυμφίος ἐπὶ νύμφῃ, οὕτως εὐφρανθήσεται Κύριος ἐπὶ σοί.
Καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τειχέων σου, Ἰερουσαλήμ, κατέστησα φύλακας ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν καὶ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα, οἳ διὰ τέλους οὐ σιωπήσονται μιμνησκόμενοι Κυρίου.
οὐκ ἔστιν γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅμοιος·
ἐὰν διορθώσῃ, καὶ ποιήσῃ Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἀγαυρίαμα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
ὤμοσεν Κύριος κατὰ τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ καὶ κατὰ τῆς ἰσχύος τοῦ βραχίονος αὐτοῦ Εἰ ἔτι δώσω τὸν σῖτόν σου καὶ οὐκέτι καὶ τὸ, βρώματά σου τοῖς ἐχθροῖς σου, καὶ ἔτι πίονται υἱοὶ ἀλλότριοι τὸν οἶνόν σου ἐφ’ ᾧ ἐμόχθησας·
ἀλλ᾿ ἢ οἱ συνάγοντες φάγονται αὐτὸ.
καὶ αἰνέσουσιν Κύριον, καὶ οἱ συνάγοντες πίονται αὐτὰ ἐν ταῖς ἐπαύλεσιν ταῖς ἁγίαις σου.
πορεύεσθε διὸ.
τῶν πυλῶν μου καὶ ὁδοποιήσατε τῷ λαῷ μου καὶ τοὺς λίθους τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ διαρράψατε.
ἐξάρατε σύσσημον εἰς τὸ.
ἔθνη.
ἰδοὺ γὰρ Κύριος ἐποίησεν ἀκουστὸν ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς εἴπατε τῇ θυγατρὶ Σιών Ἰδού σοι ὅ σωτὴρ παραγίνεται ἔχων τὸν ἑαυτοῦ μισθόν, καὶ τὸ ἔργον πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ.
καὶ καλέσει αὐτὸν Λαὸν ἅγιον, λελυτρωμένον ὑπὸ Κυρίου, σὺ δὲ κληθήσῃ Ἐπιζητουμένη πόλις, καὶ Οὐκ ἐγκαταλελιμμένη.
Τίς οὗτος ὃ παραγινόμενος ἐξ Ἐδώμ, ἐρυθήματα ἱματίων ἐκ Βόσορ;
οὕτως ὡραῖος ἐν στολῇ, βίᾳ μετὰ ἰσχύος;
ἐγὼ διαλέγομαι δικαιοσύνην καὶ κρίσιν σωτηρίου.
διὰ τί σου ἐρυθρὰ τὰ, ἱμάτια, καὶ τὰ, ἐνδύματά σου ὡς ἀπὸ πατητοῦ ληνοῦ;
πλήρης καταπεπατημένης, καὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν οὔκ ἔστιν ἀνὴρ μετ’ ἐμοῦ, καὶ κατεπάτησα αὐτοὺς ἐν θυμῷ, καὶ κατέθλασα αὐτοὺς ὡς γῆν, καὶ κατήγαγον τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν εἷς γῆν.
ἡμέρα γὰρ ἀνταποδόσεως ἐπῆλθεν αὑτοῖς, καὶ ἐνιαυτὸς λυτρώσεως πάρεστιν.
καὶ ἐπέβλεψα, καὶ οὐδεὶς καὶ προσενόησα, καὶ οὐθεὶς ἀντελαμβάνετο·
καὶ ἐρρύσατο αὐτοὺς ὁ βραχίων μου, καὶ ὁ θυμός μου ἐπέστη.
καὶ κατεπάτησα αὐτοὺς τῇ ὀργῇ μου, καὶ κατήγαγον τὸ αἷμα αὑτῶν εἷς γῆν.
Τὸν ἔλεον Κυρίου ἐμνήσθην, τὰς ἀρετὰς Κυρίου ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ὁ Κύριος ἀνταποδίδωσιν.
Κύριος κριτὴς ἀγαθὸς τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ, ἐπάγει ἡμῖν κατὰ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ καὶ κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ.
καὶ εἶπεν Οὐχ ὃ λαός μου;
τέκνα, καὶ οὗ μὴ ἀθετήσωσιν·
καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς εἷς σωτηρίαν ἐκ πάσης θλίψεως.
οὗ πρέσβεις οὐδὲ ἅγγελος, ἀλλ’ αὐτὸς Κύριος ἔσωσεν αὐτούς, διὰ τὸ ἀγαπᾶν αὐτοὺς καὶ φείδεσθαι αὐτῶν·
αὑτὸς ἐλυτρώσατο αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀνέλαβεν αὐτούς, καὶ ὕψωσεν αὐτοὺς πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ αἰῶνος.
αὐτοὶ δὲ ἠπείθησαν καὶ παρώξυναν τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον·
καὶ ἐστράφη αὐτοῖς εἷς ἔχθραν, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπολέμησεν αὐτούς.
καὶ ἐμνήσθη ἡμερῶν αἰωνίων ὅ ἀναβιβάσας ἐκ γῆς τὸν ποιμένα τῶν προβάτων·
ποῦ ἐστιν ὅ θεὶς ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον;
ὁ ἀγαγὼν τῇ δεξιᾷ Μωσῆ, ὅ βραχίων τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ;
κατίσχυσεν ὕδωρ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, ποιῆσαι αὐτῷ ὄνομα αἰώνιον.
καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτοὺς διὰ τῆς ἀβύσσου, ὡς ἵππον δι’ ἐρήμου, καὶ οὐκ ἐκοπίασαν, καὶ ὡς κτήνη διὰ πεδίου·
καὶ κατέβη πνεῦμα παρὰ Κυρίου καὶ ὡδήγησεν αὐτούς·
οὕτως ἤγαγες τὸν λαόν σου, ποιῆσαι σεαυτῷ ὄνομα δόξης.
Ἐπίστρεψον ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἴδε ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ἁγίου σου καὶ δόξης·
ποῦ ἐστιν ὁ ζῆλός σου καὶ ἡ ἰσχύς σου;
ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ ἐλέους σου καὶ τῶν οἰκτειρμῶν σου, ὅτι ἀνέσχου ἡμῶν;
σὺ ἡμῶν εἶ πατήρ, ὅτι Ἀβραὰμ οὐκ ἔγνω ἡμᾶς, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ οὔκ ἐπέγνω σύ, Κύριε, πατὴρ ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς, ἀπ’ ἀπ’ τὸ ὄνομά σού ἐστιν ἐν ἡμῖν.
τί ἐπλάνησας ἡμᾶς, Κύριε, ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ σου;
ἐσκλήρυνας ἡμῶν τὰς καρδίας τοῦ μὴ φοβεῖσθαί σε;
ἐπίστρεψον διὸ.
τοὺς δούλους σου, διὰ τὰς φυλὰς Τῆς κληρονομίας σου, ἵνα μικρὸν κληρονομήσωμεν τοῦ ὅρους τοῦ ἁγίου σου·
οἱ ὑπεναντίοι ἡμῶν κατεπάτησαν τὸ ἁγίασμά σου.
ἐγενόμεθα ὡς τὸ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς, ὅτε οὐκ ἦρξας ἡμῶν, οὐδὲ ἐνεκλήθη τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς.
Ἐὰν ἀνοίξῃς τὸν οὐρανόν, τρόμος λήμψεται ἀπὸ σοῦ ὅρη, καὶ τακήσονται ὡς κηρὸς ἀπὸ προσώπου πυρὸς τήκεται, καὶ κατακαύσει πῦρ τοὺς ὑπεναντίους, καὶ φανερὸν ἔσται τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου ἐν τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις·
ἀπὸ προσώπου σου ἔθνη ταραχθήσονται, ὅταν ποιῇς τὸ, ἔνδοξα·
τρόμος λήμψεται ἀπὸ σοῦ ὅρη.
ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος οὐκ ἠκούσαμεν οὐδὲ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν εἶδον θεὸν πλὴν σοῦ σοῦ>, καὶ τὰ ἔργα σου ἀ ποιήσεις τοῖς ὑπομένουσιν συναντήσεται γὰρ τοῖς ποιοῦσιν τὸ δίκαιον, καὶ τῶν ὁδῶν σου μνησθήσονται.
ἰδοὺ σὺ ὠργίσθης, καὶ ἡμεῖς ἡμάρτομεν·
διὸ, τοῦτο ἐπλανήθημεν, καὶ ἐγενήθημεν ὡς ἀκάθαρτοι πάντες ἡμεῖς, ὡς ῥάκος ἀποκαθημένης πᾶσα ἡ δικαιοσύνη καὶ ἐξερύημεν ὥς φύλλα διὰ τὰς ἀνομίας οὕτως ἄνεμος οἴσει καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὅ ἐπικαλούμενος τὸ ὄνομά σου καὶ ὃ μνησθεὶς ἀντιλαβέσθαι σου·
ὅτι ἀπέστρεψας τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἀφ’ ἡμῶν, καὶ παρέδωκας ἡμᾶς διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε, πατὴρ ἡμῶν σύ, ἡμεῖς δὲ πηλός, ἔργον τῶν χειρῶν σου πάντες.
μὴ ὀργίζου ἡμῖν σφόδρα, καὶ μὴ ἐν καιρῷ μνησθῇς ἁμαρτιῶν καὶ νῦν ἐπίβλεψον, ὅτι λαός σου πάντες ἡμεῖς.
πόλις τοῦ ἁγίου σου ἐγενήθη ἔρημος Σιών ὡς ἔρημος ἐγενήθη Ἰερουσαλήμ·
εἷς κατάραν ὁ οἶκος τὸ ἅγιον ἡμῶν, καὶ ἡ δόξα ἦν ηὐλόγησαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ἐγενήθη πυρί·
καυστος.
καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔνδοξα συνέπεσεν.
καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσι τούτοις ἀνέσχον, Κύριε, καὶ ἐσιώπησας, καὶ ἐταπείνωσας ἡμᾶς σφόδρα.
Ἐμφανὴς ἐγενόμην τοῖς ἐμὲ μὴ ζητοῦσιν, εὑρέθην τοῖς ἐμὲ μὴ ἐπερωτῶσιν·
εἶπα Ἰδού εἶμι, τῷ ἔθνει οἵτινες οὐκ ἐκάλεσαν τὸ ὄνομά μου.
ἐξεπέτασα τὰς χεῖράς μου ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν πρὸς λαὸν ἀπειθοῦντα καὶ ἀντιλέγοντα, οἳ οὐκ ἐπορεύθησαν ὁδῷ ἀληθινῇ ἀλλ’ ὀπίσω τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν.
ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ὃ παροξύνων με ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ διὰ παντός·
αὐτοὶ θυσιάζουσιν ἐν τοῖς κήποις καὶ θυμιῶσιν ἐπὶ ταῖς πλίνθοις τοῖς δαιμονίοις ἅ οὐκ ἔσται, καὶ ἐν τοῖς μνήμασιν καὶ ἐν τοῖς σπηλαίοις κοιμῶνται δι’ ἐνύπνια, οἱ ἔσθοντες κρέα ὕια καὶ ζωμὸν θυσιῶν, μεμολυμμένα πάντα τὸ.
σκεύη αὐτῶν, οἱ λέγοντες Πόρρω ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ, μὴ ἐγγίσῃς μου, ὅτι καθαρός εἶμι·
οὗτος καπνὸς τοῦ θυμοῦ μου, πῦρ καίεται ἐν αὐτῷ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας.
ἰδοὺ γέγραπται ἐνώπιόν μου Οὐ σιωπήσομαι ἕως ἂν ἀποδῶ εἷς τὸν κόλπον αὐτῶν τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, λέγει Κύριος·
οἳ ἐθυμίασαν ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν βουνῶν ὠνείδισάν με, ἀποδώσω τὸ.
ἔργα αὐτῶν εἷς τὸν κόλπον αὐτῶν.
Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος Ὅν τρόπον εὑρεθήσεται ὃ ῥὼξ ἐν τῷ βότρυι, καὶ ἐροῦσιν Μὴ λυμήνῃ αὑτόν, ὅτι εὐλογία Κυρίου ἐστὶν ἐν αὐτῷ·
οὕτως ποιήσω ἕνεκεν τοῦ δουλεύοντάς μοι, τούτου ἕνεκεν οὗ μὴ ἀπολέσω πάντας.
καὶ ἐξάξω τὸ ἐξ Ἰακὼβ σπέρμα καὶ τὸ ἐξ Ἰούδα, καὶ κληρονομήσει τὸ ὅρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου, καὶ κληρονομήσουσινοἶ ἐκλεκτοί μου, καὶ οἶ δοῦλοί μου κατοικήσουσιν ἐκεῖ.
καὶ ἔσονται ἐν τῷ δρυμῷ ἐπαύλεις ποιμνίων, καὶ φάραγξ Ἀχὼρ εἷς ἀνάπαυσιν Βουκολίων τῷ λαῷ μου οἱ ἐζήτησάν με.
ὑμεῖς δὲ οἱ ἐγκαταλείποντές με καὶ ἐπιλανθανόμενοι τὸ ὅρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου, καὶ ἑτοιμάζοντες τῷ δαιμονίῳ τράπεζαν καὶ πληροῦντες τῇ τύχῃ κέρασμα, ἐγὼ παραδώσω ὑμᾶς εἷς μάχαιραν, πάντες ἐν σφαγῇ πεσεῖσθε·
ὅτι ἐκάλεσα ὑμᾶς καὶ οὐχ ὑπηκούσατε, ἐλάλησα καὶ παρηκούσατε, καὶ ἐποιήσατε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἃ οὑκ ἐβουλόμην ἐξελέξασθε.
Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος Ἰδοὺ οἱ δουλεύοντές μοι φάγονται, ὑμεῖς δὲ πεινάσετε·
ἰδοὺ οἶ δουλεύοντές μοι πίονται, ὑμεῖς δὲ διψήσεσθε·
ἰδοὺ οἳ δουλεύοντές μοι εὐφρανθήσονται, ὑμεῖς δὲ αἰσχυνθήσεσθε·
ἰδοὺ οἷ δουλεύοντές μοι ἀγαλλιάσονται ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ, ὑμεῖς δὲ κεκράξεσθε διὸ.
τὸν πόνον τῆς καρδίας ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ συντριβῆς πνεύματος ὀλολύξετε.
καταλείψετε γὰρ τὸ ὄνομα ὑμῶν εἷς πλησμονὴν τοῖς ἐκλεκτοῖς μου, ὑμᾶς δὲ ἀνελεῖ Κύριος.
τοῖς δὲ δουλεύουσιν αὐτῷ κληθήσεται ὄνομα καινόν, ὅ εὐλογηθήσεται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς·
εὐλογήσουσιν γὰρ τὸν θεὸν τὸν ἀληθινόν, καὶ οἶ ὀμνύοντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ὀμοῦνται τὸν θεὸν τὸν ἀληθινόν.
ἐπιλήσονται γὰρ τὴν θλίψιν αὐτῶν τὴν πρώτην, καὶ οὐκ ἀναβήσεται αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν.
Ἔσται γὰρ ὃ οὐρανὸς καινὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ καινή, καὶ οὗ μὴ μνησθῶσιν τῶν προτέρων, οὐδ’ οὗ μὴ ἐπέλθῃ αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν, ἀλλὰ εὐφροσύνην καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα εὑρήσουσιν ἐν αὐτῇ·
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ποιῶ Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἀγαλλίαμα καὶ τὸν λαόν μου εὐφροσύνην.
καὶ ἀγαλλιάσομαι ἐπὶ Ἰερουσαλήμ, καὶ εὐφρανθήσομαι ἐπὶ τῷ λαῷ μου·
καὶ οὐκέτι μὴ ἀκουσθῇ ἐν αὐτῇ φωνὴ κλαυθμοῦ οὐδὲ φωνὴ κραυγῆς, καὶ οὗ μὴ γένηται ἐκεῖ ἄωρος καὶ πρεσβύτης ὃς οὐκ ἐνπλήσει τὸν χρόνον αὑτοῦ·
ἔσται γὰρ ὃ νέος ἑκατὸν ἐτῶν, ὁ δὲ ἀποθνήσκων ἁμαρτωλὸς ἑκατὸν ἐτῶν, καὶ ἐπικατάρατός ἐστιν.
καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιν οἰκίας καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐνοικήσουσιν, καὶ καταφυτεύσουσιν ἀμπελῶνας καὶ αὐτοὶ φάγονται τὰ γενήματα αὐτῶν·
καὶ οὐ μὴ οἰκοδομήσουσιν καὶ ἄλλοι ἐνοικήσουσιν, καὶ οὗ μὴ φυτεύσουσιν καὶ ἄλλοι φάγονται.
κατὰ γὰρ τὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς ἔσονται αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ λαοῦ μου·
τὰ ἔργα τῶν πόνων αὐτῶν παλαιώσουσιν.
οἱ δὲ ἐκλεκτοί μου οὗ κοπιάσουσιν εἷς κενόν, οὐδὲ τέκνα ποιήσουσιν εἷς κατάραν, ὅτι σπέρμα εὐλογημένον ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ ἐστιν, καὶ τὰ ἔκγονα αὐτῶν μετ’ αὐτῶν ἔσονται.
καὶ ἔσται πρὶν ἢ κεκράξαι αὐτοὺς ἐγὼ ἐπακούσομαι αὐτῶν, ἔτι λαλούντων αὐτῶν ἐρῶ Τί ἐστιν;
λύκοι λύκοι καὶ ἄρνες βοσκηθήσονται ἅμα, καὶ λέων ὡς βοῦς φάγεται ἄχυρα, ὄφις δὲ γῆν ὡς ἄρτον·
οὐκ ἀδικήσουσιν οὐδὲ μὴ λυμανοῦνται ἐπὶ τῷ ὄρει τῷ ἁγίῳ μου, λέγει Κύριος.
Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος Ὁ οὐρανός μοι θρόνος, ἡ δὲ γῆ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν μου·
ποῖον οἶκον οἰκοδομήσετέ μοι;
ἢ ποῖος τόπος τῆς καταπαύσεώς μου;
πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα ἐποίησεν ἡ χείρ μου, καί ἐστιν ἐμὰ πάντα ταῦτα, λέγει Κύριος·
καὶ ἐπὶ τίνα ἐπιβλέψω ἀλλ’ ἢ ἐπὶ τὸν ταπεινὸν καὶ ἡσύχιον καὶ τρέμοντα τοὺς λόγους μου;
ὁ δὲ ἄνομος ὃ θύων μοι μόσχον ὡς ὁ ἀποκτέννων κύνα, ὃ δὲ ἀναφέρων σεμίδαλιν ὡς αἷμα ὕιον, ὃ διδοὺς λίβανον εἷς μνημόσυνον ὡς βλάσφημος.
καὶ οὗτοι ἐξελέξαντο τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῶν ἅ ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν ἠθέλησεν, κἀγὼ ἐκλέξομαι τὰ ἐνπαίγματα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν ἀνταπο.
δώσω αὐτοῖς·
ὅτι ἐκάλεσα αὐτοὺς καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσάν μου, ἐλάλησα καὶ οὐκ ἥκουσαν, καὶ ἐποίησαν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον μου καὶ ἅ οὐκ ἐβουλόμην ἐξελέξαντο.
Ἀκούσατε τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, οἱ τρέμοντες τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ·
εἴπατε, ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν, τοῖς μισοῦσιν ἡμᾶς καὶ βδελυσσομένοις, ἵνα τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου δοξασθῇ καὶ ὀφθῇ ἐν τῇ εὐφροσύνῃ αὐτῶν, κἀκεῖνοι αἰσχυνθήσονται.
φωνὴ κραυγῆς ἐκ πόλεως, φωνὴ ἐκ ναοῦ, φωνὴ Κυρίου ἀνταποδιδόντος ἀνταπόδοσιν τοῖς ἀντικειμένοις.
πρὶν ἢ τὴν ὠδίνουσαν τεκεῖν, πρὶν ἢ ἐλθεῖν τὸν πόνον τῶν ὠδίνων, ἐξέφυγεν καὶ ἔτεκεν ἄρσεν.
τίς ἤκουσεν τοιοῦτο, καὶ τίς ἑώρακεν οὕτως εἰ ὤδινεν γῆ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ, εἰ ἐτέχθη ἔθνος εἷς ἅπαξ;
ὅτι ὤδινεν καὶ ἔτεκεν Σιὼν τὰ παιδία αὐτῆς.
ἐγὼ δὲ ἔδωκα τὴν προσδοκίαν ταύτην, καὶ οὐκ ἐμνήσθης μου, εἶπεν Κύριος.
οὐκ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ γεννῶσαν καὶ στεῖραν ἐποίησα;
εἶπεν ὃ θεός.
Εὐφράνθητι, Ἰερουσλήμ, καὶ πανηγυρίσατε πάντες οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ, χάρητε χαρὰν πάντες ὅσοι πενθεῖτε ἐπ’ αὐτῆς, ἵνα θηλάσητε καὶ ἐμπλησθῆτε ἀπὸ μαστοῦ παρακλήσεως αὐτῆς, ἵνα ἐκθηλά.
σαντες τρυφήσητε ἀπὸ εἰσόδου δόξης αὐτῆς.
ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκκλίνω εἷς αὐτοὺς ὡς ποταμὸς εἰρήνης, καὶ ὡς χειμάρρους ἐπικλύζων δόξαν ἐθνῶν·
τὰ παιδία αὐτῶν ἐπ’ ὤμων ἀρθήσονται καὶ ἐπὶ γονάτων παρακληθήσονται.
ὡς εἶ τινα μήτηρ παρακαλέσει, ὅτι οὕτως καὶ ἐγὼ παρακαλέσω ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ παρακληθήσεσθε.
καὶ ὄψεται καὶ χαρήσεται ὑμῶν ἡ καρδία, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ ὑμῶν ὡς βοτάνη ἀνατελεῖ·
καὶ γνωσθήσεται ἡ χεὶρ Κυρίου τοῖς σεβομένοις αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπειλήσει τοῖς ἀπειθοῦσιν.
ἰδοὺ ἰδοὺ γὰρ Κύριος ὡς πῦρ ἥξει, καὶ ὡς καταιγὶς τὸ.
ἅρματα αὐτοῦ, ἀποδοῦναι ἐν θυμῷ ἐκδίκησιν καὶ ἀποσκορακισμὸν ἐν φλογὶ πυρός.
ἐν γὰρ τῷ πυρὶ Κυρίου καταναλωθήσεται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἐν τῇ αὑτοῦ πᾶσα σάρξ·
πολλοὶ τραυματίαι ἔσονται ὑπὸ Κυρίου.
οἱ ἁγνιζόμενοι καὶ καθαριζόμενοι εἷς τοὺς κήπους, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προθύροις ἔσθοντες κρέας ὕιον καὶ τὸ.
βδελύγματα καὶ τὸν μῦν, ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ καταναλωθήσονται, εἶπεν Κύριος.
Κἀγὼ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν καὶ τὸν λογισμὸν αὐτῶν·
ἔρχομαι συναγαγεῖν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη καὶ τὰς γλώσσας, καὶ ἥξουσιν καὶ ὄψονται τὴν δόξαν μου.
καὶ καταλείψω ἐπ’ αὐτῶν σημεῖα, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ ἐξ αὐτῶν σεσωσμένους εἷς τὰ ἔθνη, εἷς Θαρσεῖς καὶ Φοὺδ καὶΛοὺδ καὶ Μόσοχ, καὶ Θοβὲλ καὶ εἷς τὴν Ἑλλάδα καὶ εἷς τὰς νήσους τὰς πόρρω, οἲ οὐκ ἀκηκόασίν μου τὸ ὄνομα οὐδὲ ἑωράκασιν τὴν δόξαν μου, καὶ ἀναγγελοῦσίν μου τὴν δόξαν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν.
καὶ ἄξουσιν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν δῶρον Κυρίῳ, μεθ’ ἵππων καὶ ἁρμάτων ἐν λαμπήναις ἡμιόνων μετὰ σκιαδίων, εἷς τὴν ἁγίαν πόλιν Ἰερουσαλήμ, εἶπεν Κύριος, ὡς ἂν ἐνέγκαισαν οἶ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐμοὶ τὰς θυσίας αὐτῶν μετὰ ψαλμῶν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου.
καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν λήμψομαι ἐμαυτῷ ἱερεῖς καὶ Λευίτας, εἶπεν Κύριος.
ὃν τρόπον γὰρ ὃ οὐρανὸς καινὸς καὶ ἦ γῆ καινὴ ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ μένει ἐνώπιόν μου, λέγει οὕτως στήσεται τὸ σπέρμα ὑμῶν καὶ τὸ ὄνομα ὑμῶν.
καὶ ἔσται μῆνα ἐκ μηνὸς καὶ σάββατον ἐκ σαββάτου ἥξει πᾶσα σὰρξ ἐνώπιόν μου προσκυνῆσαι ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ, εἶπεν Κύριος καὶ ἐξελεύσονται καὶ ὄψονται τὰ κῶλα τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῶν παραβεβηκότων ἐν ἐμοί·
ὃ γὰρ σκώληξ αὐτῶν οὗ τελευτᾷ, καὶ τὸ πῦρ αὐτῶν οὔ σβεσθήσεται, καὶ ἔσονται εἷς ὅρασιν πάσῃ σαρκί.

Opinions differ asto these verses, as to whetherthey original here, or in Micah iv.
1— 3, or copied by both prophets from earlier source.
Many authorities think them more naturally placedin Micah, as regards sequence of thought:
“ the passageﬁts naturally intoits context”( Sinker);
“ in any casethey are not originalin Isaiah”( Delitzsch).
On the otherhand, Micah appears to have beena younger contemporaryof Isaiah, and Mic.
iii.
, iv.
to date from the time of Hezekiah;
whereas Isa.
ii.
— iv.
are placed by practically authorities not later thanthe beginning of Ahaz’ reign.
The that both prophets borrowed from an earlier source is adopted by many critics asaway out of the dilemma;
or else thatthe passage“was assigned by some collectors to Isaiah and by others to Micah”( Prof.
A.
B.
Davidson, in the Temple ample Bible).
Other passages are found, common to two prophets;
in which case decisionis difficult,but there isa tendency, if one prophet uses the words asa sortofstarting- point, to suppose them original in the other;
see, for instance, Joel iii.
16 and Amos i.
2.
But the adapter of the words would be likely to take some care in placing them;
as Micah may have done, see Prof.
Cheyne, ad loan;
and many commentators, later aswell as earlier, think they detect likeness to the style of Isaiah here.
Isaiah's transitions, moreover,are frequently and markedly abrupt.
On the whole, his claim to the original authorship has scarcely been disproved.

20.
τοῖς ματαίοις] The Heb.
word is believed to mean‘ moles’( diggers), but was divided in most Mss.
, owing, probably, to its some- what unusual form.
The Greek may be a mere guess:
if ABBREVE were interpretedinthe sense of‘ shame,’ it mightbe thus rendered, like ABBREVE or it might( less probably)have been readas some unusual form from ABBREV E;
or μάταιος might have been taken as connected in meaning with ματεύω, and won in the sense of‘ search. ’
[ 22.
] The Lxx.
omits this verse altogether;
and probably on this ground in the ﬁrst place, its genuineness has been suspectedby some.
It is inserted( from Aquila)byQ mg, and by the Lucianic cursives, anda few others:

10— 12), instead of weightier matters, and despiteof religion.
ἐμπαῖκται] The Heb.
word is difficult;
it recurs only in lxvi.

The meaning seems to be properly abstract:
‘ childishnesses,’‘ petulances.’

but it is more probably the ‘ look’of the face, as revealed to any observer:
the LXX.
interprets well, though it is almost more shamelessness than shame thatis implied.
The genitive Σοδόμων givesa special force, which is hardly warranted by the Hebrew.
ἀντέστη] Doubtless implies coming forward in witness against :
cf.
lix.
12.
The Heb.
word usually means ‘ answer’:
Vulg.
has responrlere in both passages, and in Hos.

10 takes it froma different root,and renders humiliabitur LXX.
more consistently, if wrongly, ταπεινωθήσεται in both passages of Hosea.
10.
εἰπόντες Δήσωμεν] Lxx.

word for‘ Say ye’as‘ Letus bind,’ with root- letters ABBREV for ABBREV εἰπόντες, as in ver.

The MSS.

Tertullian also, Adv.

22, has Venite,’ nquz’ unt, auferamus iustum quid inutilis est nobis.
There is a certain neatness about the Greek;
and the alternative reading supports the syntax and theD:
but the Hebrew has the parallelism in its favour, and the Creek is perhaps inconsistent with καθ’ ἑαυτῶν.
δύσχρηστος] seems to have more force than the inutilis of Tertullian, which wouldbe merely ἄχρηστος, as in Hosea viii.

πράκτορες] Vulg.
exactores.
There are two similar roots in Heb.
, ABBREV and ABBREV meaning respectively‘ be with young’ and unjustly,’‘ ill- treat.’
The formeris preferable here, the sense resembling ver.
4;
but Lxx.
have rendered as from the latter.
καλαμῶνται, ‘ glean, ’ almost in sense of English ἀπαιτοῦντες] Heb.
‘ women.’
One discrepancyin the mm.
is often followedby more,a wrong ideaof the contextperhapsinfluencing the translator.
Here it looks as if ABBREV‘ and women,’ had been with ABBREV ‘ oppressors’ just above, the parallel‘ children’ having been lost.
μακαρίξοντες] Vulg.

The former is probably right, and generally adopted.

LXX.
slightly departs from Heb.
, substituting ‘ coal’ for ῾tongue.
φλογὸς ἀνειμένης] The translatorseemsto have adaptedtheparticiple with some freedom.
In xxxv.
3 it clearly means‘ relaxed,’ and the Heb.
has much thesame meaning here,‘ sinketh down’but applied to ﬂame, it seemsto mean, necessarily, something like‘ streaming’:
cf.
Euripid.
Andromache 598, πέπλοι ἀνειμένοι.
χνοῦς] Probably LXX.
read ABBREV‘ chaff,’ for ABBREV‘ rottenness’:
cf.
xvii.
13 xxix.
5, & c.
The MSS.
constantly confuse χνοῦς and whichQ* reads here, with aboutsix cursives.
Thus ΑΓ are probably wrong in reading χοῦς both in xvii.
13 and xli.
15, andAin Hos.
xiii.
3.
χνοῦς generally represents ABBREV and χοῦς( sometimes γῆ) ABBREV but for the latter, in2 Sam.
xxii.
43 AB and ﬁve cursives have χνοῦς, and in Ps.
xviii.
42, the parallel passage, RABR and 90 cursives.
In Isai.
xlviii.
19 Heb.
has a different word altogether, andℵis probably wrong in reading χνοῦς there.
λόγιον] Heb.
word is not the most usual one, though froman ordinary root.
The Greek is perhaps intended to give an idea of formal solemnity:
cf.
xxviii.
13, xxx.
27( different Heb.
).
παρώξυναν] This verb, or παροργίζω, is often used in LXX.
, where Heb.
probably means rather‘ scorn,’‘ despise,’ or‘ forsake. ’
A kindred word is renderedby ὀργή, xxviii.
3, and παροργισμὸς in the parallel Kings xix.
3.
In these places, andi.
4, Heb.
has ABBREV but παροξύνω represents ABBREV below, ver.
25, xiv.
16, xxiii.
11;
while ABBREV is ἐπικράνθη in xiv.
9, and θυμωθήσεται xiii.
13.
παροξύνω stands for ABBREV, lxv.
3 ABBREV xxxvii.
23, for whichin2 Kings LXX.
has ἐβλασφήμησας.
while there is no exactcorrespondenceof words, Lxx.
seem generally to emphasize the determined malice of rejection.
On the other hand οὐκ ἠθέλησανis almosta meiosis for ABBREV‘ reject’;
and so οὐ βούλομαιalmost= ῾refuse,᾿ viii.
6, xxx.
9, and βούλομαι,‘ desire,’ i.
29.
25.
ἐν πᾶσι] ἐπὶ is used for Heb.
3, where the refrain recurs.
26.
The enemy, as yet unnamed, is probablythe Assyrians μακρὰν, ἀπ’ ἄκρου τῆς γῆς) not Syriaand Ephraim.
Those who do not seek to limit the bearings of prophecy may see a further reference tothe Babylonians,who followed Assyria as world- monarchs and oppressors.
The description ﬁts either well enough;
cf.
Habak.
i.
6– 11.
σύσσημον]Α sign agreed upon, esp.
for battle.
The appointed instruments are ready.
συπιεῖ αὐτοῖς] ℵΑQ* and eight cursives have dat.
:
so Heb.
, but singular throughout this passage.
B ἃς.
have αὐτοὺς, in whichcasewe can only render,‘ hiss them on’:
whereas A 's text and Heb.
mean‘ hiss tocall them,’ cf.
vii.
18, and Zech.

Burkitt, Tyconius,’ us, p.

, points out that theO.
L.
read acc.
with συρεῖ, Cyp.
Testim.
1.
21 having etadtrahet illos, and the ῾Speculum᾿ et trahet eas.
This must be due to misreading the Greek;

Α omits πεινάσουσιν οὐδὲ;

Also naturally for‘ be hungry,’ as in xxix.

ἐλογίσθησαν] Seems best taken with the words that follow, though itis possible to join it withthepreceding clause,as in the Heb.
29.
ὁρμῶσιν] ὀργιῶσιν,read byB, istome unintelligible, whether supposed to bea late formfor ὀργῶσιν, or to come from ὀργίαζω or ὀργίζω, withωfor ου.
The cursive 305 paraphrases νυ.
2830 and the word ὁρμὴ occurs in its paraphrase:
Field pointed out in the Herapla that Syro- hex.
has here a form of the word used for‘ leap’ in xxxv.
6.
ὁρμῶσιν does not correspondtothe Heb.
, but may bea guess of the translator.
Had the LXX.
originally written a late form suchas ὤρυσαν, it would hardly have been lost, owing to Symm.
and Theod.
's rendering.

ὑψηλοῦ καὶ ἐπηρμένου] It isaquestion whether the epithets inthe Heb.
refer to the throne, as Delitzsch, Cheyne,and others, or as Kay thinks, to the Lord Himself.
The end of the verse seemsa rather weak paraphrase in the Greek:

κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ] Probably‘ around Him’ rather than‘ around it,’ the throne, in Greek;

κατανένυγμαι] The word occursin LXX.

7, ‘ the men were’;
of Aaron, Lev.
x.
3;
of Ahab,I Kings xxi.
27, 29 in Psalms iv.
4, xxx.
12:
in Leviticus and Psalms, the Heb.
word is the same as,or akin to, that here used.
Liddell and Scott give for κατανύσσομαι νύσσω,‘ prick’) the meanings(i)be sorely pricked,( ii)be stupefied, slumber:
“ in latter senses, perhaps corrupted from κατανυστάζω.
” Bengel on Acts ii.
37 quotes the Vulgate’ sunt, and on Rom.
xi.
8, which quotes Isai.
xxix.
10,“ κατάνυξις notat πάθος ex frequentissima punctionein stuporem desinens.
” The Heb.
verb( or verbs)=(i) be silent, amazed,( ii) be ruined.
Consequently the Heb.
and Greek words approach one another only in the meaningsof‘ stupefaction’ and‘ silence.’
Vulg.
has( and here:
which Prof.
Skinner,on this passage, in Camb.
Bible for 55110013, calls an impossible rendering;
but it is hardly certain that this is so of the Greek, even ifit be of the Hebrew;
for it is quite possible that LXX.
may have so interpreted the original;
and it seems as easya sense as any to assign to κατανένυγμαι.
The force of the expression seems to have some similarity to Jerem.
i.
6, ‘ I cannot’:
and to’ reluctance, Exod.
iv.
10 — 13;
but with Isaiah it is not so much backwardness as overwhelming surprise and sense of unworthiness.
If we taketheother meaning,‘Iam pricked'might possibly be for‘I am sore stricken,’ witha reference to the idea thata sight of God heralded death:
see Judg.
vi.
22, xiii.
22, Exod.
xxxiii.
20, Deut.
v.
24, 26, and Gen.

30;
which is the earliest mention for certain of the feelings, though there it seems already familiar.

λαβίδι ἔλαβεν] Heb.
words also cognates.
7.
Like Ezekiel( chap.
ii.
, iii.
) and St John( Revel.
x.
8 — 10) Isaiah's experience shows that the work of anapostleor prophet,to whom the secrets of God are revealed— see Amos iii.
7 — has a sweet and a bitter side.
His lips are purified;
but he will not be believed.
Yet with Isaiah, more thanany other,except St John, the exaltation of spirit remains dominant;
we see no sign, after this, of his confidence failing.
Jeremiah, by nature, seems to stand at the other end of the scaleof temperament;
near him, perhaps, Thomas, Hosea, Micah, Habakkuk.
περικαθαριεῖ] The forceofthe compound is as though the defilements peeled or sloughed off.
The Heb.
has passive verbs, or their equivalent:
Vulg.
auferetur.

mundabitur:
Aq.
Symm.
Theod.
ἀποστή- σεται.
.
.
ἐξιλασθήσεται.
8.
πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον] Heb.
has‘ for us, ’ ABBREV which LXX.
perhaps read as ABBREV‘ to a nation’;
τοῦτον may be due to the influence of ver.
9, cf.
Acts xxviii.
26.
With the loss of‘ for us’ disappears, in the LXX.
, the only evidence that more Persons than one are spoken of in this chapter.
Ἰδού εἰμι ἐγὼ] The Heb.
has no verb expressed:
so ἰδοὺ ἐγώ, Gen.
xxii.
I.
II, & c.
In some books, mainly Judges- Kings—but see chap.
xliii.
25 — ἐγώ εἰμι is frequently used for‘I,’ even as the subject ofa verb:
e.
g.
Judg.
vi.
18, xi.
27, 35, 37 ( not A in xi.
), Ruth iv.
4 2 Kings iv.
13 εἰμι ἐγὼΑ).
In these passages Heb.
has the longer form of pronoun ABBREV but not here.
ℵΓ, several cursives,and Sixtine text, read ἐγώ εἰμι here:
41 90 144 omit verb :
text is that of ABQV 22 48 51 93, 62 147, 26 301 306.
9.
ἀκούσετε] ἀκούσητε, read byΑΓ and fourorﬁve cursives,will scarcely construe, does not match βλέψετε, and is not supported byN.
T.
quotation;
probably corrupted by the proximity of συνῆτε.
Ἀκοῇ ἀκούσετε.
.
.
βλέποντες βλέψετε] Heb.
has imperative, and theverbs are intensified, according toa frequent idiom, by repetition in the‘ absolute’ infinitive.
This the LXX.
represents by the participle, or nounof kindred meaning.
Opinions often differ as to the shade of meaning conveyed by this Hebrew idiom;
thus Delitzsch renders here, Hear on‘:
‘ Hear ye still’:
‘ Hear ye continually,’ R.

On the passagein Acts, Mr T.
E.
Page says:
“ The fut.
ind.
after μὴ represents the action of the verbas more vividly realized as possible and probable than is the case when the subj.
follows.
The change from the subj.
to the ind.
here is very forcible and vigorous.
” It is, however, probably due, in the ﬁrst place, to literal representation of the Hebrew, here the“ converted” perfect, equivalent to the imperfect or future.
The Greek translator may,it is true, have felt καὶ to have some such force as is expressed in English by ‘ in which case.
.
.

Cf.
the use of ἵνα with past indic.
in Greek;
though it is not suggested that the parallelis exact:
as in Eurip.

Aquila in such cases uses τῷ λέγειν, in his literal fashion:

The nominative participle produces anacoluthon in Greek, but isnot uncommon in phrases likethe present:
λεγόντων may be viewed as an attempt to save the grammar.
τὸν οἶκον Δαυεἰδ] Eitherthe court circle, or the royal family.

A good dealof uncertainty remains, as the MSS.
often vary, and the grammatical points may depend on terminations of which the letters are few, and easily confused.
In the LXX.
, Hebrew influence may affect the construction, but mainlyinthe tendency to use aor.
and fut.
indicative.
Still, irregularities inthe use of ἂν especially as to its omission with subj.
, are not very conspicuous.
Despite the suspicion caused byA's irregular placingof ὅταν, it may be right toreadit here, with Q θc.
;
and ἐὰν may be rightin xxxi.
4.
If ὅταν is here, an alternative wouldbe to read ἐσαλεύθη.
supposing ε to have dropped out betweena preceding and following σε the syllabic augment does not seem to be omitted.
( The reading ἀρθῇin xviii.
3 is not certain.
) The argument that irregularities of grammar occurring in the MSS.
are likely to be genuine is largely balanced by the consideration that the grammarof the earlier writers would probably have been less bad than that of later scribes.

Ahaz colours his refusal of God’s offer witha show of obedienceto the Law(Deut.

This hypocrisy— it can hardly be anything else— is brushed aside.
Possibly Ahaz thought by his to cast discredit on Isaiah and his mission;
doubtless he wished to be undisturbed in his Assyrian policy.
He is likeKing John asdrawnby ShakeSpeare, weak, hypocritical, intriguing, false, and regardless of his’s honour.
It is quite possible that hehad some ability, some original promise and capacity for good;

Though God will not be turned fromHis purposes of mercy, man can often deprive himself of the advantageof them.
We can easily believe that this sign brought Ahaz little comfort.
ἡ παρθένος] Heb.
has the article.
The commentators have devoted pages to this verse.
Many deny that the Heb.
word necessarily means a virgin;
but in practice it seems to be generally,if not always, used of such.
The ultimate reference to our’s birth of the Virgin Mary is guaranteed by Matt.
i.
23, if it could be, in any case, disregarded.
But those who look for a nearer reference in’s own time have been sorely puzzled.
They cannot ﬁnd the mother, virgin or not, nor identifythe child Immanuel.
In their vain efforts—see Prof. ’
s nots— Isaiah's own Hezekiah, and allegorical personification have all been pressed into the service.
Better, perhaps,to allow that if there be( necessarily)an immediate reference to’s own time— with regardtowhich the questionof the virgin is possibly not—we can reachnocertainty about it.
And it is not well to deny the possibility that the sign was given ina deferred form, which would Comfort believers,and be—to There may well have been, however,at this time, one who, though never recognised asa person of importance, was nevertheless destined to be the mother ofa child,the direct ancestor of the parent( or parents,as reputed)of the ﬁnal King of the House of David:
namely, the wife, or wifeto be, of the then representativeof the familyof Nathan,sonof David, from whom our’s descent is traced in Luke iii.
This family has only once marked attention drawn to it in the O.

in Zech.
xii.
12;
its importance arose only with the failure of issue from Jehoiachin, Jerem.
xxii.
30, nor did it, apparently, retain high station after Zerubbabel, but fellto humble circumstances.
The idea ofa reference toa member ofit here isbuta guess, and throws no light on the question of the παρθένος.
It presents, however,no Special difficulties, and may perhaps be thought to providea suitable contrast and, at the same time, relation to the‘ house of’ of’ day.
It is perhaps worth noticing that all the names mentioned in Zech.

The omission of ἢ before προελέσθαι might be right:

The verb προελέσθαιis itself awkward:
Cyp.
l.
c.
has pracferat;
but is not the meaning of the Heb.
, though a kind of sense can be made of the alternativeof choosing evil or good.
But if it is notaduplicate of ἐκλέξασθαι which has taken the place of the real verb before πονηρά, perhaps περιελέσθαι( Josh.
xxiv.
14, 23), in the sense of‘ to remove,’ may have been the original Greek.
We still have the difficulty of the different renderingofABBREVin 16,by ἀπειθεῖ, which, if taken as an adjective, fails to give sense, and asa verb givesan unbalanced sentence, and is in an unlikely tense.
ἀπειθεῖν would slightly ease the sentence, and Hatch, Essays in Bibl.
Greek, IV.

O.

These considerations point to some such text as βούτυρον καὶ μέλι φάγεται, πρὶν ἢ γνῶναι αὐτὸν περιελέσθαι πονηρά, ἐκλέξασθαι τὸ ἀγαθόν.

I" simply τῷ μεμεθυσμένῳ;
Β τῷ μεμισθωμένῳ, with Heb.
;
so Theod.
Symm.
, but Aquila μεμεθυσμένῳ.
The main question is between these two participles;
the Heb.
means‘ hired,’ decidedly:
though, bya curious coincidence, had it been read as from ABBREV instead of ΑΒBREVE it would have been taken to mean‘ drunken.’
The exact, form used is not found in the case of ABBREVE but this is probably not conclusive;
it does not occur elsewhere from the other verb.
The reading ofA seems preferable, as being the result of a misreading of the Hebrew, whereas the correct reading may have come in from Theod.
and Symm.
( Syro- hex.
margin with A, text withB).
The converse misreading occurs at xxviii.
I, 3, and a similar case of resemblance bothin Gr.
and Heb.
at xiv.
21.
Of course the correct rendering ofB would be preferable, if the other could be accounted for in that case.
It seems almost possible, indeed, that both readings may have existed from the ﬁrst, as alternatives;
in which case τῷ μεγάλῳ may have been inserted when μεμισθωμένῳ was displaced, from a sense that somethingwas missing:
though the Hebrew has nothing answering to it.

Α omits ὥστε πληρῶσαι( alone)and reads τὰ πλάτη with 24 26 49 90 106 I44 233 239vid 306 :
also, ℵctΑ 106 haveεἷ for ἢ before δυνατὸν, andA 24 συντελέσαι for συντε- λέσασθαι.
None of these readings ofA, except τὰ πλάτη, are very likely to be right:
εἶ for ἢis either one of the commonmistakesin vowels,or an intentional touching up:
ὥστε πληρῶσαι is probablyan accidental omission.
παρεμβολὴ]Α favourite wordof LXX.
, generally rendering Heb.
Mahanch, ‘ camp, ’ ‘ host.’
It is saidtobea Macedonian word, which would account for its Alexandrian use.
Here it seems to be due to the LXX.
taking‘ wings’ to refertoan army, and paraphrasing.
Skinner doubts whether Heb.
ever‘ wings’ this sense.
μεθ’ ἡμῶν ὁ Θεὸς] The nameImmanuelis translated here by LXX.

12.
The other words are alike in mean-.
ing, but thishas altered the drift:
the negative in rendering the Heb.

.
( It wouldbepossible to putthestop after χειρὶ instead of after Κύριος, and translate ἀπειθοῦσιν asa participle:
‘ Thus saith the Lord, with the strong hand, to men that’&c.
The sense is perhaps but we should certainly have expected τοῖς ἀπειθοῦσιν if thishad been intended, and λέγοντεςisa ﬂiculty hard to surmount, unless itbe supposed to have been altered.

On the negative, see below.
The case- relation is reversed in λίθου προσκόμματι and πέτρας πτώματι, but this affects the sense little.

Τοῦτο πρᾶτον πίε] The Lxx.

as at thetime at ﬁrsthe treated lightly the land of Zabulon and landofN aphtali, so(lit.
and) in the timeto come he treated heavily(i.
e.

and such passages as chap.

Marc.
Iv.
7, “ Hoc primum bibito(v.
1.
obito.
a fairly evident corruption), facito””—is well- nigh hopeless.
It be best to compare the Greek, word by word, with the literal rendering of Heb.
:
καὶ οὐκ ἀπορηθήσεται Yet no gloom ὁ ἐν στενοχωρίᾳ ὦν ΝβQ NBQ] for whom distress:
ἕως(? ὡς) καιροῦ as( at) the time τοῦτο πρῶτον at ﬁrst πίε, ταχὺ ποίει he treated lightly χώραΖ.
ἡ γῆ Ν.
the land ofZ.
and land ofN.
καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ and in the( time)to come he treated heavily ὁδὸν θαλάσσης[ om.
ℵ*B] the waybythe sea&c οἱ τὴν παράλιον κατοικοῦντες&c παραλίανBQ, om.
κατοικοῦντες ℵ*B.
The quotation, Matt.
iv.
15, begins with γῆ Ζαβουλών, after the main difficulty.
I suspect that οἱ λοιποί, though looking like an attempt at rendering‘( time)to come,’ is an additionof the Greek, and κατοικοῦντες alsosuperfluous:
οἱ τὴν παράλιον( κατοικοῦντες)and ὁδὸν θαλάσσης, which is given by Aq.
Theod.
, being in fact duplicate renderings.
Apart from this, we have words corresponding to all the Hebrew except ‘ he treated heavily,’ and to all the Greek except πίε.
This Hebrew word, ‘ heavy, ’ ABBREV has the secondary meanings of‘ sullen,’‘ grievous,’ on theone hand,and‘ grave,’’ honourable,’ on the other.
Now παχὺς corresponds nearly to some of these meanings:
see Aeschylus, Suplices, 618, πόλιν παχῦναι, Septemc.
Theb.
771 ὄλβος ἄγαν παχυνθείς;
and note, chap.
vi.
10, where ἐπαχύνθη is used of the heart, and ABBREV ina parallel clause, of the ears.
( παχὺς and παχύνειν are not found in theO.
T.
as rendering words from root ABBREV but they render ABBREV‘ beara load,’ as Eccl.
xii.
5( in Hithpael,‘ becomea burden’) παχυνθῇ ἡ ἀκρίς, Ps.
cxliv.
I4 οἱ βόες αὐτῶν παχεῖς.
And ABBREV is rendered by κῦδος, xiv.
25, δόξα and τιμὴ( xi.
10) being familiar equivalents for ABBREV so also τιμὴ for ABBREV Ex.
16, LXX.
being apparently strong on the connection between‘ fatness’ and‘ honour. ’
) It seems, therefore,as though παχὺ might reasonably be expected here.
Similarly, ταχὺ is not abad representative of the word ABBREV‘ treat lightly,’ the noun from which is rendered by κοῦφος, xviii.
2, xxx.
16, cf.
v.
26.
For the passage of meaning from κοῦφος to ταχὺς an analogy is suggested by Lucretius, IV.
183,“ Persaepe levis res atque minutis Corporibus factas celeris licet esse videre.
” If ταχὺ and παχὺ had both been in the original, their similarity might easily cause one to drop out;
and πίε, which is scarcely intelligible, may bea corruption from some other arrangement of letters.
Summing up these ideas, it may be suggested that the Greek textranoriginally somewhat as follows:
καὶ οὐκ ἀπορηθήσεται ὁ ἐν στενοχωρίᾳ ὤν.
Ὠς καιροῦ τοῦ τὸ πρῶτον ταχύ, ἔπειτα παχὺ ποιεῖ.
Xώρα Ζαβουλὼν,κ.
τ.
λ.
Except ὡς for ἕως, the alteration fromthe ΜSS.
consists of reading ΠΡΩΤΟΝΤΔΧΥΕΠΕΙΤΔΠΔΧΥΠΟΙΕΙ for πρωτον πιε τσχγποιει.
This corresponds nearly word for word with the Heb, though not preserving much sense;
and this kind of correspondence is frequent in the LXX.
Χώρα following might be for χώραν, object to ποιεῖ;
written as χωρᾶ;
but the syntax must have been lost after that.
St’ s quotation is hardly conclusive, because starting withthe words‘ The land ofZ.
, ’ he would naturally use the ὁδὸν θαλάσσης] These words are read only byℵ* ca AQ 24 26 90 106 144 233 239 306, and assignedto Aq.
Theod.
by Qmg.
They are found in Matthew, and agree with Heb.
, while οἱ τὴν παράλιον κατοικοῦντες),as said above, appears to bea duplicate rendering.
Were it not for the supportof’s text, the evidence would on the whole point to οἱ τὴν παράλων( or παραλίαν)the true LXX.
, its MS.
evidence including ℵ *Band many cursives, while the more literal rendering might have come in from Aquila or Theodotion.
The evidence ofa N.
T.
writer is however almost conclusive, unless we suppose that ὁδὸν θαλάσσης came from Matthew into the MSS of the LXX.
;
as 301 reads ἀνέτειλεν for λάμψει in ver.
2.
Finally, it might be supposed that there were alternative versions current, both of which our Mss.
represent more or less faithfully, and perhaps with mixture;
Matthew and Theodotion having both used that containing ὁδὸν θαλάσσης.
The‘ way ofthe’is generally taken to mean the western side of the Sea of Galilee:
but it has also been referred to the track by the Mediterranean coast.
The‘ Via’ of the Crusadersran from Acre to Damascus.
τὰ μέρη τῆς Ἰουδαίας] Added after ἐθνῶν by ℵΑΒQ 26 49 90 106( 301), while seven Lucianic MSS.
have τὰ μέρη τῆς Γαλιλαίας τῶν ἐθνῶν.
The mention of Judaea has no warrant from the original:
the authorities for it are mainly Hesychian;
and it suggests intentional insertion, by one who thought Judaea ought to have, or must have had, its shareinthe prophecy.
The reading Ἰουδαίας in Luke iv.
44 has always seemed to the present writer suspicious, though so highly supported. ’
2.
The quotation in Matthew continues:
he reads καθήμενος withA against Heb.
, σκοτίᾳ for σκότει, εἶδεν with Heb.
against tom- of LXX.
this last is a matter of vowel points, Lxx.
reading the word as am.
imperat.
, for am, perf.
3 pl.
Matthew seems either to have quoted with some independent use of the Heb.
, or else fromadifferent Greek version, coming nearer to’s than toB'd text:
unless indeed A 's text was affected by thatofthe Gospel.

Against its claim to stand as part of the true Lxx.
text are the following reasons:
( a) It is not inℵ* BQ, nor,e silentio,in other MSS.
not named above:
and is marked with an asterisk in 48.
( b) It isaduplicate rendering,in great part, of the text as standing without it.
(c) lts wording coincidestoa great extent with Aq.
Symm.
Theod.
, though not identical with any one of these.
On the otherhand, it is nota mere insertion from either ofthe later versions, due tothe Hexapla:
for it does not agree with any of them entirely, and ἐξουσιαστὴς, τοῦ μέλλοντος, differ from them all:
and Clement of Alexandria( Paed.
l.
24) quotes it in the form θαυμ συμβ.
θεὸς δυναστὴς πατὴρ αἰώνιος·
ὄρχων εἰρήνης, where δυναστὴς suggests remembrance both of ἐξουσιαστὴς and of the later’ δυνατός.
Irenaeus also( Adv.
Haer.
IV.
33.
II), as preservedinthe Latin version, has Admirabilis consiliarius Deus lortis;
and θεὸς is not in Aq.
Symm.
Theod.
The simplest explanation seems to be, that an alternativetextof the LXX.
, of which Theodotion, followed probably by Symmachus, made use, has hereleft traces, which have been preserved side by side with the other, which in the present state of our evidence we must call the true Lxx.
That this latteris inferior, viewed asa faithful rendering of the Heb.
, need cause no surprise, as the true mm.
of Daniel is commonly agreed to be inferior to the version which Theodotion chose for his revision:
naturally he would choose the best available.
The relation to Aquila's version is, however, hardly clear.
Something similar, in thematterof alternatives, of which the better hasnot always prevailed, is describedby MrF.

ΑΒΒREVE and the letters ABBREVE occur intheHeb.
of this verse, which has beenrather freely treated, whether by paraphrase or misreading.
Kay, without special reference to the LXX.

“ Under Pekah, Ephraim had thoroughly adopted the God- defying policyof Babel.
” Scholz thinks λίθους due to reading ABBREVE for ABBREVE but the letters are not very near, and οἰκοδομήσωμέν itselfis in the verse.

τοὺς ἐπανιστανομένους ἐπ’ ὅρους Σιὼν] Heb.
‘ the adversariesof Rizin,’ referring apparentlytothe Assyrians, but ﬁcult, or at unexpected,so that many modern authorities seekto alter it, and read the ‘ princes of’ with some MSS.
, or else omit‘ of’ making it‘ his,’i.
e. ’
s‘ adversaries.’
See, however, Kay, Delitzsch,W.
E.
Barnes on the other side.
According to Scholz, Lxx.
read ABBREVE ABBREVE ABBREVEfor ABBREVE ABBREVE but if the order of words is kept, ἐπανιστ.
answers to ἣν, and ῥάξει to ΑΒΒREVE In xiii.
16, ῥάξουσιν renders Heb.
ΑΒΒREVE there is no ordinary Heb.
word very near the required meaning, which could well have been mistaken here;’
is perhapsthe nearest.
ABBREVE ABBREVE would have been nearer the Heb.
, but the phrase‘ rock of’ seems not to occur;
and, as it seems in itself not unnatural or inappropriate, was probably avoided of set purpose.

The verse corresponds with Heb.

It is probably an addition to suit the following verse:

The LXX.
has lost the parallelism:
Heb.

But there is nothing in the context to suggest Egyptian gods.
Cheyne remarks,“ The Sept.

After these words RA and most cursives( and Syro-hex.

but the context, up to the end of ver.
11 scarcely suits this rendering.
ὀργῆς] If thisbe right, Lxx.
are simply paraphrasing:
butB reads ἡ ὀργὴ, which has the more original look.
It is probably an interpre- tation of‘ staff’:

‘ If’and‘ for,’ as wellas‘ when.
are various renderings possible for Heb.
ABBREV The word for‘ altogether can also mean‘ only,’ hence μόνος.
The remaining differences of number, person,c.
are such as occur constantly, as between Heb.
and Lxx.
A state of things is describedinthe original, which is best illustrated in modern history by Napoleon's marshals,who rose, often from the ranks, to become dukes and princes, and eventitular or actual kings, as in the case of Bernadette and Murat.
In ancient times Alexander's generals founded dynasties in Egypt, Syria,& c.

Ben- hadad of Syria had ﬁrst‘ kings,’ then‘ captains,’ in subordinate posts of leadership,I Kings xx.

Lxx.
differs considerably from Heb.
, apparently explaining and paraphrasing:
it can hardly be brought into any direct relation with the Heb.
text.
τὴν χώραν τὴν ἐπάνω Βαβυλῶνος may be taken to express generally the translator's idea oftheposition of Carchemishand Calno, but see below:
ἔλαβον isanatural insertion, and Ἀραβίαν may have taken theplaceof Arpad, though ther is the only common to the two.
Herodotus, II.
141, speaks of Σαναχάριβον βασιλέα Ἀραβίων τε καὶ Ἀσσυρίων.
For οὗ ὁ πύργος ᾠκοδομήθη, Cf.

Here Cheyne thinks ABBREV was misread ABBREV‘ fort.’
But it lookslikea comment, identifying Χαλαννὴ with Calnehof Gen.
x.
10, and combiningthe from Gen.
xi.
2.
In that caseitwas near Babylon;
“ the later Ctesiphon on the left bank of the Tigris,” acc.
to Delitzsch.
Some authorities, however, think that this is to be identifiedwith the CalnehofAmos vi.
2, and not with that of Genesis:
placing it near Arpad.
Carchemish, probably far upon the Euphrates, an importantcity of the Hittitepower before this time:
Hamath and Arpad, inN.
Syria.
All these were captured by the Assyrians between 740 and 717B.
C.
It is well known that Stephen's speech, Acts vii.
43, finishesa quotation fromthe LXX.
of Amosv.
25 — 27 with a substitution of ἐπέκεινα Βαβυλῶνος for ἐπέκεινα Δαμασκοῦ.
It seems just possible that this passage of Isaiah was also in his mind.
Anyhow, with the history of Judah's captivity also in his mind, he may well have changed the name intentionally, and the intention may have been obvious to his hearers.
‘ Beyond Babylon’ was historicallytrueof the ﬁnalofIsrael also,2 Kings xvii.

The cursives are divided, the majority having χώρας:

Given πόλεις, κατοικουμένας is what we should expect LXX.
to give.
( The Heb.
text is slightly uncertain.
) The rest of ver.
14 is paraphrased, but the general sense is fairly near.

The text of NA is supported by 24 26 49 90 106 144 239 306 mainly Hesychian evidence:
also by Q, except that it has φόβος in both clauses.
When the order of words or clauses differs thus,B is generally nearer to the Hebrew:
and so here τοῦ ὤμου agrees more nearly with Heb.
, though as‘ neck’is omitted altogether,on that hypothesis, ὤμου might stand for it;
in that case,‘ shoulder’is the word omitted, and the ζυγὸς of ABBREV&c.
is in its rightplace to the Heb.
φόβος does not correspondto‘ burden’with any exactness,and it is curious that in thevery similar passage, xiv.
25, the samewordis rendered bytheunusual word κῦδος:
the verb is renderedin4 ἀνέχομαι, ἀναλήμψομαι It is temptingto suggest that φόβος isacorruption of φόρτος,‘ burden’:
but this will not bring Heb.
and Greek into exact correspondence.
Scholz gives the words καὶ ὁ φόβος αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ σοῦas an additiontothe Greek text:
and Cheyne, in his critical note, The Propheciesof Isaiah, ed.
3, Vol.
II.
p.
146, says,“ The Septuagint version evidentlycontainsduplicate renderings, and the better one is καὶ καταφθαρήσεται ὁ ζυγὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ ὤμων ὑμῶν”;
which words follow next.
But neither of these notes seems to present the facts with complete accuracy:
for if the LXX containsany superfluous words, they must have taken the place of others that are now lost:
but in fact there is nothing certainly added or duplicated.
The text here and in xiv.
25 may have been confused:
but except in the curious rendering of ABBREV‘ burden,’in each place, there is nothing more thana looseness not uncommon in the LXX.
's rendering.
ἀπὸ τῶν ὅμου ἡμῖν] Heb.
‘ because of(lit.
from the face of) oil' or‘ fatness.’
These Heb.
words are obscure in meaning, and have been suspected,as well as variously taken.
ABBREV ‘ oil,’ and ABBREV‘ shoulder,’ havecertainlysome resemblance,more especially in some scripts near the time when the nor.
was made.
Lowth thought that the max.
reading was ABBREV for ABBREV and proposed to follow it.

Ὄρασις] The Heb.
Massa, translated‘ burden,’ according to its relation to verb to bear,'‘ lift up,' or‘ oracle.’

elsewhere generally by λῆμμα, according to Liddell and Scott ﬁrst the matter ofa sentence,as Opposedtoits style, then the title or argument ofapoem or book, and so for the poem or song itself.

ἐγὼ συντάσσω, κ.

λ.
] The text here is discussedbyMr Burkitt, Tyconius,p.
cxiv.
foll.
He points out that the reading of the Lucianic cursives, with 62 147, is εγω συντασσω γηιασμενοι εισιν και εγω αγω αυτους( α)( So Tycon.
p.
50 nearly, see below.
) Β* omits ηγιασμενοι εισι and(according to Camb.
LXX.
) αγω( β) ℵΑΒmgQ read εγω συντασσω και εγω( αγω) αυτοθς·
ηγιασμενοι εισι και εγω αγω αιτους( β2)A omits αγωthe first time.
Of these he decides for(a) which Dr Field printsin his 1859 edition.
“ It has equivalents,” he says,“ though they are unintelligent, for eachHebrew word initsproper order.
” αυτους he explains as dueto reading ABBREVas ABBREV for ABBREV:
ηγιασμενοι εισι he suggestsmaybe due, somewhat similarly, to reading ηγισςμενοιω as ηγιαςμενοι;
and there remains the difference that Tyconius agrees with the Heb.
in reading et voco eos( =και καλω αυτους) where the Greek has καὶ ἐγὼ ἄγω αὐτοὺς( the cursive 301has ἐγὼ συντάσσω καὶ ἐγὼ καλῶ αὐτοὺς ἡγιασμένοι εἰσὶν).
He thinks thatB* omitted ἡγιασμ.
εἰσὶν as awkward, and that β2 is an attempttoemend β by α:
unless, indeed β came by homoeoteleuton from β2:
“ but in that caseitis very difficultto explain how β2 ever came into existence.
It does not commend itself as an original, or asa translation, and it does not appear in any text earlier than the Hexapla.
” Agreeing that( α)is the best reading, and the nearest to the original LXX.
,I suggest that the processof corruption was this:
καὶ ἐγὼ ἄγω was originally καὶ ἐγὼ καλῶ or καὶ καλῶ:
this bhecame καγωκαγω( or καικαγω), and then καὶ ἐγὼν ἄγω.
ἡγιασμένοι εἰσὶ was then dropped out, and when it was replaced, καὶ ἐγὼ ἄγω αὐτοὺς was written before it as wellas after, some confusing having arisen, and the corruption from καλῶ to ἄγω having induced scribes to couple it with συντάσσω.
γίγαντες ἔρχονται πληρῶσαι τὸν θυμόν μου] so ℵAB:
106 has παῦσαι for πληρῶσαι, and the Luc.
MSS.
, 62 147 have τὸν θυμόν μου παῦσαι.
So Tyconiusp.
50 has gigantes veniunt iram meam lenire(v.
l.
mitigare).
Here ἔρχονται andthe following infin.
have no corresponding Heb.
, and itmaybe inferred, that the version supplied them to give sense( or to paraphrase ABBREV);
παῦσαι and πληρῶσαιmayhave been alternatives, even from the first, and the order of the Luc.
MSS.

Heb.

βασιλέων] βασιλειῶν is the rendering of the later Greek versions, and agrees with Heb.
The change would be small, but the word in this sense, and in the plural, is not known in the LXX.
6.
συντριβὴ παρὰ, τοῦM] Heb.
‘ like Shuōd from Shaddai,' meaning of which latter term isnot very certain, but may mean ‘ mighty to destroy,' with Delitzsch:
the phrase occurs also Joeli.

Ὠρίων] One ofthe chief constellations:
called the Giant( Al- Jauza)by the Arabs;
in the Greek mythology, Orion wasa giantand hunter, concerning whom the legends vary widely.
There are many references to him as a constellation in the classics:
Hom.

Euripides, Jan, 1152, ὅ τε ξιφήρης Ὠρίων.
The Hebrew is Chesil, the identification being at least exceedingly probable:
it is rendered by Ὠρίων also in Job ix.
9, xxxviii.
31, Amos v.
8.
The name means ‘ fool’ or‘ conﬁdent’;
the verb occurs, Jerem.
x.

Here it is used in plural, probably meaning‘ such constellations as Orion καὶ ὁ κόσμος τοῦ οὐρ.

word means‘ goats’( hairy ones):

occurs again only Exod.
xii.
19, and in Exod.
ii.
22 as quotedby Philo.
προστεθήσεται] Not here usedas an auxiliary, but representingtwo different Heb.
words;
the second of which, however,may very likely have been taken for the Niphal of ABBREV insteadof ABBREV.
2.
καὶ πληθυνθήσονται] An additionby the LXX.
It seems best to keep ἔθνηas the subjectof the verbs, in which case κατακληρονομή σουσιν is causal,‘ shall make them to inherit.
' ABBREV alonesupplies οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, as in Heb.
τοῦ Θεοῦ] Omitted byB.
Heb.
has‘of the LORD.
3.
θυμοῦ] The Heb.
word means‘ vexation’or‘ disquiet,’ but sometimes‘ fury,’ as in Habak.
iii.
2.
4.
Θρῆνον] Heb.
word mdslzdl generally means a parable or parallel, and hence sometimesa‘ taunt- song.’
The poemwhichfollows bears, by irony, the formof an elegy, which seems the justification of the LXX.
's rendering, found here only;
though we may compare such passages as Lam.
ii.
15 foll.
, Ezek.
xxvi.
17 foll.
, xxxii.
18 foll.
, and almost the whole of xxvii.
There seems to have beena tendency in other languages to employ the metres of elegy for satiric purposes:
Horace's epodes,the Archilochian metres which he borrows, Martial's epigrams, the γνῶμαιof Theognis,and some of Propertius' poems, are instances, in varying degrees.
ὁ ἐπισπουδαστὴς] Heb.
word occurs only here, and is obscure.
Many, including A.
V.
, have taken it as connected with ABBREV the Aramaic form of ABBREV‘ gold.’
Delitzsch interprets it from another root, as' place place of torture.
' Lxx.
are generally thought to have read numb,‘ insolent dealings,' cf.
Ralzab, xxx.
7, li.
9, instead of ABBREV Most moderns are inclined to follow this reading.
ἐπισπουδαστὴς( cf.
κατέσπευδον, Exod.
v.
10, 13 ) seems to mean ‘ one who presses hard’ another, Le.
a hard taskmaster.
Vulgate has tributum.
5.

the latter wordso rendered again, ver.
29.
6.
ἀνιάτῳ] Not the sameHeb.
expression as in xiii.
9, though the word for' wrath,' close by, is the same.
παίων] Heb.
rather ‘ ruling,’‘ subduing’:
LXX.
has thus for once increased the parallelism:
but their rendering is loose, the vague θυμοῦ taking the place of ‘( with)a pursuit.
'' Restrained'is taken in another aspectas‘ spared,’ cf.
Prov.
xiii.
24, and in different syntax.
The relative is probably right, see R.
V.
ἀνεπαύσατο πεποιθὼς] These words belong in the Heb.

14.
ἐπικράνθη] Heb.
‘ is disturbed,' whether with trembling or wrath:
the same root as the word rendered by θυμοῦ, ver.
3;
θυμωθήσεται is used forthe verb, xiii.
13:
παροξύνων, below, ver.
16.
συνηγέρθησαν] The voice of the verb and its number are different from the Heb.
, as well as the number of ἐγείραντες, so that both are made to refertothe giants, the meaning being hard to ﬁnd:
either the giants are ﬁrst roused, and thenrouse the kings, or perhaps more reasonably ἐγείραντες is more in the sense of the Heb.
‘ disturbed.’
The giantsare angered and appalled atthe new arrival, as kingshad been at them.
γίγαντας] Heb.
Rephaim,a— or words, for there are probably at least two roots concerned — with several meanings, the cause much confusion in the versions:
( a)a people living apparentlyE.

10 ἰατροί) Mistakes between(a) and(b)are less important, and(c) is generally securedby the context:
but(d) causes difficulty, hence ἰατροὶ wrongly twice in Lxx.
, and medici in Vulg.
of Psalm lxxxviii.
( The Psalter which appearsinthe Vulgate is not Jerome's version from the Heb.
, as in mostO.
T.
books, but his second revision from the Old Latin.
based therefore on the Septuagint, called the‘ Gallican Psalter.
' The translationinour Bookof Common Prayer, through the‘ Great Bible.

has gigantes regularly.

Καὶ σὺ ἑάλως] There isno interrogative particlein the Greek, nor in the Hebrew.
Many authorities, but not Kay,take the latter, however,as a question.
LXX.

are generally printed as a plain statement.
ἁλῶναι, in the sense ‘ to be vanquished,' is near the Hebrew, but not exact.

Feasting was the order ofthe night,it may be, before the fall of Babylon and of many an ancient strong city.
It may be noticed that nowherein Dan.

The dazzling apparition of Babylon among the nations is compared to the splendour of the morning star.
Prof.
Skinner is surely right in defendingA.

's rendering‘ Lucifer’:
he points out how this name came to be applied to the Devil, by connecting this passage with Lukex.
18, ἐθεώρουν τὸν Σατανᾶν ὡς ἀστραπὴν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πεσόντα.
That our Lordwas referring to this chapter is rendered probable by the resemblance of Lukex.

Margoliouth thinks( Lines of Defence,p.
128), the word in one or both of those passages comes from another root, foundin Arabic,and meaning' witchcraft ὁ ἀποστέλλων] Cf.

2;
but evidently here Lxx.
misread ΑBBREV participle of ABBREV‘ discomﬁt,’‘ weaken,’ and tookit from ABBREV‘ send,’ transposing the letters.
Both verbs may be followed by the preposition ABBREV which LXX.
perhaps read again as 53, since they insert πάντα.
13, 14.
We are reminded of the Towerof Babel,but it is not easy to ﬁnda complete parallel to this enormous pride.
See however the difficult chapter, Ezekiel xxviii.
The ascription of divine origin to Greek heroes and their houses is ona different plane altogether, and the defication of Roman emperors a mere mockery and degradationof the godsinwhich few hadanyreal belief.
Nearer parallels may however be found in Indian mythology:
a convenient example may be quoted from Southey's Curse of Kehama( xii.
8):
“ Up rosetheRajah through the conquer'd sky,To seize the Swerga for his proud abode;
Myriads of evil Genii round him ﬂy,As royallyon wings ofwindshe rode, And scaled high Heaven, triumphant likea Godl.
' ὑψηλῷ] This clause paraphrases the Heb.
;
it is just possible that ABBREV‘ assembly,’ was readasABBREV‘ power,’‘ excess,’ generally used adverbially, often rendered σφόδρα.
14.
Tertullian, adv.

" Mr Burkitt points outin his Introduction,p.
lix.
, that in ver.
13 Tyconius agrees with Cyprian in reading‘ stellas Dei':
“ Is it possible," he asks, “ that οݲυݲνݲοݲυݲ of the MSS.

has been preserved only in the African Latin?” 15.

word already used in ver.
13, but notdirectly rendered there:
ofa ship, jonahi.
5( κοίλην).
16.
Οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος] Heb.

Men gaze in half- frightened derision at the corpseon the battlefield.
as the Shades do at the new comer among them.

<καὶ τὰς πόλεις( αὐτοῦ) καθεῖλεν>] αὐτοῦ is omitted 41 49 106 239 301 306,and there are other variations, the Lucianic cursives mostly reading καθελών.
Α omits the whole clause, but thisis probably an inadvertence.
τοὺς ἐν ἐπαγωγῇ]‘ Those in his train, ' i.

The long processions of prisoners area common feature in the Assyrian conquerors' sculptures.

generally represent them rightly by ἀνὴρand ἅνθρωπος respectively, see on ii.

ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν] Heb.
‘ from thy grave.
' Probably a guess of the LXX.
νεκρὸς] An explanationof Heb.
netser, a branch;
Scholz thinks suggested by the similar letters.
μετὰ πολλῶν τεθνηκότων] Although a similar metaphor occurs in ver.
11, LXX.
have paraphrased‘ clothed with the slain':
cf.
Ps.
lxv.
13 εἰς ᾅδου] Heb.
has here‘to the stones of the pit.
19, 20.
The discrepancies increase.
ὃν τρόπον ἱμάτιον must be ABBREV read for ABBREV‘likea carcase,' and καθαρὸν probably ABBREV for ABBREV‘ thou shalt be joined'( so Scholz,who assigns the mistakesto sound, but there is also the common confusion of ABBREV and ABBREV There isa perceptible resemblance to the Heb.
, rather than the LXX.
of ix.
4.
ἐν αἵματι πεφυρμένον is ABBREV interpreted as in Ezek.
xvi.
6, 22.
Then ABBREV‘ with them,' was read as ABBREV σύ.
Lastly, καθαρός, if not addedtocomplete the sense, would seem to be ABBREV‘ cleansed,’ for ABBREV perhaps with some confusion with ABBREV above.
20.
σπέρμα πονηρὸν]The same phrase( in Heb.

4 not found elsewhere.
21.
τὸ, τέκνα, σου] Heb.
' his sons,' the difference of ABBREV‘ thy’ and ABBREV‘ his.’
After πατρὸςABBREV have σου, probably to match the previous clanse,B and the later versions agreeing with the Heb.
, reading αὐτῶν.
πολέμων] Heb.
‘ cities,’ ABREV or, as some render it‘ enemies’:
so in Dan.
iv.
19( 16 Aramaic), Lxx.
and Theodotion have τοῖς ἐχθροῖς σου.
Here the later Greek versions all have πόλεων, which is read byV 109 305 307 308.
The evidence of Syro- hex.
is divided.
Cheyne( following Hitizig?) wishedtoread ABBREV‘ heaps’:
Ewald to alter more considerably to ABBREV‘ terrible ones.
' The resemblance between‘ cities’ and‘ enemies’ in Greek, and the identity of form in Heb.
, is curious, but has probably little to do with the real issue.
Probably πολέμων, if not altered or corrupted from πολεμίων, is the real LXX.
;
being as near to the original‘ enemies,’ if so rendered, as the translators might be expected to go.
In Ps.
lxxiii.
20 Lxx.
( and Vulg.
) have the converse difference.
See Vol.
I.
Introd.
p.

As to the alternativerenderingsof the Hebrew,‘ cities’ appears to givethe best sense:
building being a favourite occupation of great conquerors, and almostan inherited tradition of the empire of Babel.

Βαβυλωνίαν] The pronounand proper namein Heb.

σπέρμα] Heb.
‘ issue and offspring,' an alliterative pair:
σπέρμα also in Gen.
xxi.
23 but coupled with ὄνομα:
in Job xviii.
19 ἐπίγνωστος.
A.
V.
‘ nephew’is doubtless used in its old sense,=‘ grand- son'( nepos).
Scholz thinks the second word of the pair has been read into τάδε;
ABBREV for ABBREV but apart from the slightness of the resemblance, the renderingin Genesis is against this.
23.
Cf.

21, 22.
ἐχίνους] Cf.
xxxiv.
11, Zeph.

14.
Many support this rendering of the Heb.
;
others, with A.
V.
, think the bittem is meant,a marshbird, formerly found in England.
This seems on the whole preferable;
its habits are suitable, and a bird seems necessary for the verse in Zephaniah.
The bittern 's alleged habitof rolling itselfup like a hedgehog seems only worth mentioning on the chance that the name of one creature might be transferred tothe other.
βάραθρον]Α reads βάθρον=' foundation' or‘ pedestal’:

The next four verses, with a sudden transition, deal with Assyria's fall.
From the point of view of those who maintain the unity of the Book of Isaiah.
Delitzsch( ed.
3) explained thus:
“ Asshur perishes".
.
.
" Only after this had taken place couldaprophecy against Babel, the inheritress of the broken world- power of Assyria, be appropriate.
The two prophecies against Babel and Asshur, therefore,as they stand here, form a Hysteron proteron.
" He proceedsto compare Jer.

Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκδικῶ ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα] Βαβυλῶνος καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ καθὼς ἐξεδίκησα ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Ἀσσούρ“ The one event is the guarantee of the other.
" Ver.

24 — 32 to Isaiah, while his authorship of xiii.

They generally divide the dating 24— 27 after, rather than before 28— 32.
This verse, in itself, might have stood in connection with what precedes:

It is generally agreed that this verse is the heading to the passage that follows.
The Heb.
demonstrative used favours this view( Davidson, Heb.
Syntax, § 4) and such indications of date stand elsewhere at the beginning rather than the end ofa prOphecy.
As far as the Greekis concerned, the LXX.
cannot be said to maintain the old distinction in the use of οὗτος and ὅδε:
see ver.
4, τὸν θρῆνον τοῦτον.
Α further questionis, whether‘in the year that kingA.
died' means before or after his death.
The same difficulty occurs in vi.
1.
Kay thinks after, Cheyne and Delitzsch before.
The point is probably impossibleto decide:
and the range of time is probably not great;
what seems tobe clearly indicated in each case is, that the king's death, eitheras imminent,or as recent, was the prominent event in the mind in connection with the utterance of the prophecy.

The Philistines are warned not to exult over the death of some enemy, because his successor will be more terrible;
and the third more terrible again( unless the‘ ﬁery serpent' is takenas simply parallel to the‘ viper’).
Delitzsch, following the Targum and Jerome, interprets of the kings of the line of Judah, culminating in the Messiah:
his note should be consulted, to do his view justice;
but the reference to Gen.
xlix.
17 and the Danite origin of Samson the’ s great enemy seems beside the mark, and on general grounds the serpent is the last comparison to the Davidic dynasty that would be expected.
Most modems( Kay, Cheyne, Driver, Skinner,W.

Barnes, & c.
) take it of Assyrian kings.
According to the as generally accepted as any at the present day, Tiglath- Pileser died inthe same yearas Ahaz,or in the year before or after.

τοῦ εἶναι] Some words seem to have dropped out from the Greek, in rendering or in transmission.
The Lucianic cursives generally read τοῦ μεῖναι ἐν τοῖς συντεταγμένοις αὐτοῦ or similar words:
and 106 301( 144 233) read μεῖναι, which is perhaps right, representing ABBREV read as ABBREV or ABBREV, cf.

Modern critics have their doubts as to Isaiah's authorship, gemerally however excepting xvi.

The style of the rest is considered somewhat archaic;
Gesenius has been followed by many in his idea that Isaiah took upan older prophecy, adding an epilogue of his own:
Hitzig guessed Jonah as the author:
the occasion of the prophecy is unknown;
a supposed invasion of Moab by JeroboamII.
of Israel has been suggested.

The connection with Heb.

the verb may be rendered elsewhere.

Even if the Heb.
word for‘ more,’ lit.
‘ additions— ABBREV— could have suggested Suph( sea of Suph=the Red Sea), and so Arabia, we have still ἀρῶto account for;

Jerome and Theodoret say that Ar- Moab was sometimes called Ariel.
Ἀδαμὰ] Heb.
Adāmah= ‘ ground,’‘ land’;

it has been suggested that Moab, as descended from Lot, might be spoken of as a remnant of Admah, one of the neighbour cities of Sodom and Gomorrah( Gen.

The divergence of LXX.
from Heb.
at the openingof this chapter is curious, but easily explained.
The words have been differently divided:
after the difference of person between‘ Send ye, ABBREV and ἀποστελῶ, ABBREV or‘ prophetic perfect,' ABBREVwe have, Heb.
the lamb( to)the rulerof the land, ABBREV ABBREV LXX.
ὡς ἑρπετὰ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ABBREV ABBREV or simply ABBREV and perhaps ABBREV rather ABBREV So Scholz;
indeed, the stateofthe case is palpable.
It can hardly be doubted that the Heb.
text is right:
the tribute of sheep from Moabis referred to, 2 Kings iii.
4.
Moab is now advised to return to its old allegiance.
It is doubtful whether the fugitives, in the following verses, are thoseof Judah or Israel, forced over the border into Moab, or Moabites, themselves in distress:
some’ are ambiguous, both in Heb.
and Greek:
Moab afforded a refuge to Elimelech, Ruthi.
I, and to David's family,I Sam.
xxii.
3, 4 :
but the prophecy seems to be concerned with thefateof Moab, exclusively:
and most modern authorities take this view.
Possibly, therefore,the text- translation of ver.
4a, and that in the footnote, Vol.
I.
p.
125, should exchange places:
but the question remains very uncertain.
2.
ἔσῃ] Heb.
has 3rd pers.
:
B, with some cursives, repeats ἔσῃ before θυγάτηρ, where Heb.
has 3rd( or 2nd)pers.
fem.
plur.
ἐπὶ τάδε] The Heb.
for‘ fords’ isa word which enters into various adverbial or prepositional phrases meaning‘ beyond,’‘ across,’‘ because of,'&c.
Scholz, reading the Greekas ἔπειτα δέ,as most, if not texts previous to the Camb.
Lxx.
have it( so BbQa), explains it as ABBREVi.
e.
I suppose, as ABBREVfor ABBREV.
πλείονα may betocomplete the senseof ἐπὶ τάδε, or a paraphrase of the Heb.
verb with‘ counsel’:
which means,‘ make to go, '' adnace':
as in the phrase‘ stricken in years,' lit.
‘ advanced in days.
3.
ποίει τι σκέπην] The syntax differs here in Greek and Heb.
, and there seems to be some confusion.
ποίει τε corresponds to ABBREV ‘ execute’;
if read ποιεῖτε, Heb.
margin has the plur.
:
σκέπην, except forthe order, should correspond to 153,‘ thy shadow,' but possibly this word ςγ, which hasa form ςςχ, was confused with ABBREV;
in this case ABBREV‘ make,’‘ set,’ may have been readas ABBREVa‘ complaint’;
διὰ παντὸς is then ABBREV‘as the night,' read as the adverb‘ entirely,’ with different vowel- points:
ἐν μεσημβρινῇ agrees With Heb.
, σκοτίᾳ is the verb‘ hide,’ takenasa noun,‘a secret place,' omittingr;
φεύγουσιν, ἐξέστησαν,are‘ outcasts,’‘ wanderers,’ two participles taken as equivalent to verbs.
μὴ ἀχθῇς] μὴ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς, ℵAB*Q*Γ 22corr 24 26 49 106 109 233 301 305 309 :
but the reading ofB* b, μὴ ἀχθῇς, is mostprobably right,— see Vol.
I.
Introd.
, p.
130— as it appearsto come fromthe Heb.
not.
' read with different vowel- points asa passive ofthesame verb, in the sense‘be not led away'( captive).
The readings ἀχθεσθείς, 62 147and ἀχθεσθῇς, 93, seem to come from taking ἀχθῇς( intransitively) from ἀχθέω;
ἐπειχθῇς, 41 306, might possibly be the true reading, but seems quite as likely to bea mixture ofA'sandB's texts.
The Syrohexaplar version gives in its text, according to Field, the equivalentof μὴ ἀχθεσθῇς, in the margin that of μὴ ταραχθῇς, each of them fairly reasonable attempts to get sense.
A's reading is puzzling:
it may be(a)acorruption from ἀπαχθῇς, or some other verb:
( b) ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς, an additional phrase of the Lxx.
, which has turned out the verb from the clause, owing to its being itself mistaken fora verb:
it is noteasy, however,to account for its presence in this character:
( c) from ἀπόρχω,‘ rule afar off,' almost=rule in exile.
Pind.
Nem.
IV.
76, ἔνθα Τεῦκρος ἀπάρχει.
In this case we may render‘ lest thoube an exile, ' or‘ seelestthou be,’ as the pres.
subj.
cannot properly be prohibitive.
4.
Μωὰβ] On the whole, best takenas genitive after φυγάδες, and so also Heb.
:
some, however, treat itasa vocative in Heb.
, and if so, it might also be soin Greek.
ἤρθη] Perhaps can,‘ there is none,' read as ABBREV‘ take away';
so Scholz;
but this would not be passive, and the difference in meaning is here slight.
συμμαχία] Heb.
‘ extortioner’;
the discrepancy is hard to account for.
συνετελέσθη ταλαιπωρία] These words, found onlyinA 49 106,are perhaps Hexaplaric, inserted from Symmachus.
They agree pretty well with Heb.
ὁ ἄρχων] An addition to explain ὁ καταπατῶν:
probably not a.
duplicate and periphrastic rendering, by the orderof words.
ἐπὶ] So ℵAQ* 24 26 41 49 106 109 239 301 305 306 309 :
B ἀπὸ, which agrees with Heb.
, and may be Hexaplaric, from Aquila:
otherwise, ἐπὶ may be an alteration to suit κατοπατῶν:
in some ways this seems more likely.
ἔξῆρας] SO ℵcbABabQ* 26 49 106 :
ἐξῆραℵ*B*, preferable, though as the word is in any case an error, there is little in the context or otherwise to decide upon.
Heb.
has ABBREV‘ and his wrath'(a feeling that passes bounds):
ἐξῆρα is due to reading‘I took( caused to pass)away':
the 2nd pers.
would be without ﬁnal’.
οὐχ οὕτως]This is rightthe ﬁrst time, Heb.
ABBREV the second time Heb.

7.
τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Δέσεθ] Scholz, taking the division of words δὲ Σέθ, as inthe old editions, considers that LXX.
read ABBREV ABBREV omitting Kir:
the Heb.
ABBREV is generally now translated' raisincakes,' but is not very certain:
the older authorities generally made it‘ foundations.’
The parallel verse in Jeremiah has ABBREV‘ men’;
the verb in xlvi.
8, with root letters likethe present word, has often, though accordingto modern authority wrongly, been connected with trim,‘a man.
' It seems likely, therefore, that LXX.
, either connecting ABBREV with ABBREV orby guess work, paraphrased with τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν, and Δέσεθ is the common reading of ABBREV for ABBREV:
Kir,as Scholz thinks, being omitted, and onlyn remaining unaccounted for.
μελετήσας] This verbin LXx.
often represents ABBREV which= moum,' and also‘ meditate’:
xxxviii.
14, lix.
3, 13.
Its sense here is not very clear.
καὶ οὐκ ἐντραπήση] Heb.
has no negative:
Lowth suggested therefore that LXX.
read ABBREV for ABBREV and, with further alteration both of Heb.
and Greek, that ἐντροπήσῃ represents Niphal of ABBREV ABBREV instead of ABBREV Scholz rather vaguely,“ Entweder von ABBREV Oder ABBREV Compare ver.
12 ἐντραπῆναι:
and for this verb representing Niph.
of ABBREV see xli.

καταπίνοντες] Reading ABBREV‘ swallowing up,'for ABBREV' lords' cf.
Numb.
xxi.
28, where Lxx.
has κατέπιεν στῆλαι·
Ἀρνών.
The Heb.
is ambiguous:
‘ the lordsof nations her choice plants struck down, some authorities making‘ lords’the subj.
of the verb, and ‘ plants’ the obj.
, others the converse:
but this παρὰ προσδοκίαν seems hardly befitting to attribute toa Hebrew prophet.
οὗ μὴ συνάψητε] Heb.
has again no negative here;
the verb in Heb.
belongs to the previous clause, and is 3rd pers.
plur.
,a difference of vowel- points οἱ ἀπεσταλμένοι] Heb.
‘ offshoots’ is from rootmeaning‘ send forth.’
Heb.
verb ‘ to be spread abroad' also means‘ to be left.
9.
τὰ δένδρα σου] Scholz suggests, but doubtfully, that LXX.
read hat,i.
e.
ABBREV‘ thy cedars'for ABBREV‘I will water thee.
κατέβαλεν] Heb.
‘ with my tears':
what verb LXX.
read is open to doubt:
perhaps ABBREV‘ destroyed’or ABBREV‘threw down,' instead of ABBREV <Ἐλεαλὴ> ἐλάλησεν again ℵΑΒabQ* and abouta mostly Hesychian( 26 87 90 91 97 104 106 228 239 301 306 309);
ἐλάλει 24, ἐλάλησενℵ*.
Compare xv.
4.
The corruption have taken place here ﬁrst, as its support is somewhat wider:
ἐλάλησεν is repeated in the Greek of ver.
13 below.
καταπατῆσαι] Heb.
‘ shouting’:
perhaps a loose interpretation or guess, connecting the word with the treading of the grapes.
Or ABBREV may have been read as ABBREV or ABBREV from ABBREV‘ tread’ ABBREV with same meaning, differs morein letters).
Vulg.
has vox τῶν ἀμπελώνων σου] Heb.
‘ from thearden land', Carmel:
which LXX.
seems to have read as ABBREV for ABBREV Β is therefore probably wrong in omitting σου.
πέπανται γάμ] Some Lucianic MSS.
add κέλευσμα.
It is often said that Mark xvi.
8 breaks off in the middle ofa sentence, γὰρ being unlikely to stand at the end of one.
But if this verse be notanundoubted instance, Gen.

30) NBQ read εἷςfor ὣς·
ABBREV for ABBREV and the Lucianic cursives have ὥστε ἐντ.
, which looks likea correction of the Greek.
After the infinitive and σε, the MSS.
, except A, have ὅτι:
but if σεrepresents ABBREV read as ABBREV this must bea duplicate.
χειροποίητα] Probably an interpretation of Heb.

' Many commentators propose to emend the Hebrew text in agreement with the Lxx.
, reading ABBREV for ABBREV and ABBREV for ABBREV Lagarde pointing out that(??)and ABBREV look very much alike in some old forms of script.
The LXX.
, however, have the names in reverse order.
Some have wished to goa step further, and read‘ Hittites’ for' Hivites.
' These attempts at emendation are hardly advisable, though the referencetothese and their neighbour tribesis undisputed.
The use of the word ABBREV in ver.

Some, again, refer it to Syria and her allies, some to foreign hosts unspecified, but mostto the Assyrians:

The constant repetition of words has probably confused the translators.
νῶτος] Heb.
‘ tumult,’ ABBREV which has perhaps been supposed to come from ABBREV in the sense of‘ make level' όμαλίσῃ, xxviii.

The mistake might be due to sound, or tothe Aramaic form, as ABBREV Later in the verse the same word seems to be rendered correctly enough as ἠχήσει:

( Some Heb.
MSS.

in inserting‘and’ before‘ he shall not be.
' XVlll.
Opinions have differed as to the nature of the scene depicted in this chapter.
Some have thought that the‘ messengers’are ambassadors fromEthiopia to Judah, hidden to return to their own country, bearing the’s saying as their answer.
Less favoured is the idea that the embassy is from Judah to Ethiopia( though see xx.
4, 5, and Ezek.
xxx.
9);
while perhaps the majority of modern commentators think that the ‘ messengers’ are thoseof the king of Ethiopia sentto muster his more distant forces.
Again, some( as Kay) think that the remarkablydescribed nation of ver.
2 and 7 is Judah :
but it is generally,and more reasonably, taken of the Ethiopians( see below).
The prevailing view, at any rate, is that Ethiopiaiscalled upon, not to unite her forces, or joinwith Judah, against the Assyrian;
but to witness his destruction;
to stand still, and see the salvation of God, and in days to come, to turn to Him with offerings.
The EthiOpians of this time would seem to have formed the best element in the Egypt- Ethiopia combination.
It is curious that ancient testimony is generally favourable to them. ’
s testimony to their‘ blamelessness’( Iliad,I.
423) must notbeunduly pressed, nor perhaps that of Aeschylus, Frag.
300, γένος μὲν αἰνεῖν ἐκμαθὼν ἐπίσταμαι Αἰθιοπίδος γῆς.
( Memnon also seems to be presented asa gracious type of manhood.
Herodotus says of them, 111.
20, λέγονται εἶναι μέγιστοι καὶ κάλ·
λιστοι ἀνθρώπων πάντων, and the storyinthe following chapter givesa favourable impression of them.
Isaiah himself has apparently neither fault to ﬁnd, nor woe to predict against them:
whereas several of his propheciesconcerning foreign nationsare sympathetic, the tone is here almost respectful.
The Ethiopians, often important, were now becoming for the time dominant in Egypt.
In’s time, Tirhakah( xxxvii.
9) raised his peOpleto great power, and wasa vigorous opponent of Sennacherib.
There are difficulties about the chronology here, as throughout the whole period:
the destruction of the Assyriansis generally dated, since critics have placed their reliance on the Assyrian Eponym Canon, in 701B.
C.
:
but Tirhakah didnot become king, according to students of Egyptian history, till from three to ten years after this:
though an Ethiopian dynasty was ruling from an earlier date.

οὐαὶ γῆς πλοίων πτέρυγες] This verse begins obscurely in the Heb.
:
the word’ l- tsal( with ‘ wings’ following) being rendered(a)‘ of the clangour( or rustling)of’:
so Gesenius, Delitzsch, Cheyne,c.
:
( b)‘ of the shadowingof wings,' Kay,A.
V.
nharly:
( c)‘ where the shadowfalls both ways'(i.
e.
within the tropics), Knobel,W.
E.
Barnes.
The word is probably identical with that meaning‘ cymbal,’ and so Vulgate, Vac terrae cymbalo alarum.
In(a) the‘rustling of wings’ is supposedto refer tothe swarms of insects:
Kay explains(b) as the shadowingwings of empire:

Ezek.

In translating the Greek it would be possible to take Οὐαὶ γῆς together, see oni.
24:
πλοίων πτέρυγες following asacan:
pendent:
‘ Ah fortheland, the sails of the’:
but it seems more probable that γῆς qualifies πλοίων, which isa mere guess.
Lowth denies that the Heb.
word for‘ wings’is ever usedofthe sails of ships:
but so obviousa metaphorical use can hardly be called impossible, and Skinner mentions that the Targ.
supports it.
It may be noted that Lxx.
have already twice in the book used πλοίων somewhat at random :
namely, ii.
16, and xi.
14, where Heb.
‘ shoulder,’ ABBREV differs only by the middle letter fromABBREV‘ wing,’ which occurs just above.

συναχθήσεται.

συναχθήσεται may however be due to reading or guessing ABBREVas ABBREV and ἥξει an attempt at parallelism.

τεθλιμμένων καὶ τετιλμένου]ℵ alone adds καὶ τοπεινοῦ;
variants among the cursives include τεθλιμμένου καὶ τεταπεινωμένου 49 239 306( 36 228 nearly).
This rendering is nearer than that given in ver.
2, to what was formerly thought the Heb.
meaning:
cf.
Vulgate,‘ divulso et dilacerato.
' As to τεθλιμμένουwe may conjecture that Lxx.
here read ABBREV for ABBREV cf.

Here μέρος seems to be used with some reference to division, whether of spoil or otherwise:
cf.
μερὶς above, xvii.
14, μεμιῶ σκῦλα, Exod.
xv.
9, c.
Yet we should scarcely have discovered this from the Greek alone:
it almost suggests elementary lexical work on the’s part.
Moreover, it leavesit uncertain whether Lxx.
connected ABBREV with ABBREV‘ take the spoil, as most authorities used to render it:
see A.
V.
, and Vulg.

ἀνθρώπων] Inserted by Lxx.

it may be due to an early scribe.
κυρίων σκληρῶν] Heb.
is plural, so called, of‘ majesty’( adj.
in sing.
).
βασιλεῖς σκληραί, following, is sing.
in Heb.
witha different adjective, often meaning strong(' rex fortis,' Vulg.
);
here probably‘ harsh’ or' stem.
What is meantbythe‘ harsh lord'is very uncertain, whether a foreign oppressor or a king ruling over the country, by usurpation or otherwise.
On the whole, the balance of opinion seems in favour of its being an Assyrian( Esarhaddon, who was not, however,for an Assyrian,a specially‘harsh lord,' or Assurbanipal);
or an Ethiopian( Pianchi Mer- Amon, whose date is probably too early, or Tirhakah).
Delitzsch supports the Egyptian Psammetichus:

αἱ διώρυγες τοῦ ποταμοῦ] Quite a correct description:
the trenches dug from the Nile for irrigationare meant.
Heb.
uses the plural of the word regularly standingin sing.
for the Nile itself:
but this does not correspondin the order, the verb ABBREV‘ are emptied,'‘ dwindle,’ standing herein Heb.
The neglect of the machinery for irrigation in times of misrule or political disorder, or a natural failure of the annual overflowof the Nile, produced disastrousresultsin Egypt, where the crops depended entirely on the river water, the rainbeing very scanty.

The corresponding verse in2 Kings(xix.

Whether Lxx.
made συναγωγὴ from some supposed meaning of ABBREV( or ABBREV or read some other word, such as ABBREV for ABBREV( cf.

Mazor, a singular form of the dual name Mizraim, Egypt.
Its literal meaning is probably‘ wall’or‘ fortiﬁcation.’
According toDelitzsch and others, it stands especiallyfor Lower Egypt, Pathros being Upper Egypt, and thetwo together Mizraim.

The Hebrew here has ABBREV‘ meadows’ or‘ open spaces':
but in Genesis ABBREV which is said to be an Egyptian word, of which ἅχι isaGreek form or corruption:
meaning‘ reeds’ or‘ marsh- grass.’
It isnot impossible that Lxx.
read ABBREV here:

βύσσον] Heb.
‘ white cloths,' perhaps cotton as well as linen.
The local knowledge of the translator was probably equal to this rendering.
( Gen.
xli.
42 has στολὴν βυσσίνην.
) There is probably no reference in the original to nets or ﬁshing in this verse.
10.
διαζόμενοι] Heb.
probably‘ pillars’ or‘ foundations’( Ps.
xi.
3), but it has been very variously rendered, some supposing it to have to do with nets or weaving.
The LXX.
reading is of interest.
Most MSS.
, headed byℵ*B, read ἐργαζόμενοι:
AQ* have διαλογιζόμενοι, and διαζόμενοι is read by ℵcb(vid) 26 49 106 301.
The last is,I cannot but think, the true reading.
( διάζεσθαι and δίασμα occur inA'stext of Judges, xvi.
13, 14.
) ἐργαζόμενοι is eitheran attempt to explain theless known word, or simply repeated by inadvertence from the previous verse:
and διαλογιζόμενοιa guess byascribe, who,not knowing διάζεσθαι, supposed the letters to have fallen out.
( See note,Vol.
I.
Introd.

30.
) ζῦθον]‘ beer’:
evidently LXX.
read ABBREV,‘ strong drink,’ for ABBREV,‘ hire.’
Cf.

20, xxviii.
1, 3.
Some think the LXX.
rendering to be right(e.
g.
Prof.
W.
E.
Barnes).
ψυχὰς] Heb.
is singular.
A.
V.
takes it collectively as living creatures, i.
e.
in this connection‘ fish.’
But the meaningofthe verse is probably asinR.
V.
;
the word redered ‘ grieved’is identical in letters with‘ pools’ or‘ ponds’in Heb.
LXX.
may have read it or regarded it as the same wordas ABBREV,Job xxx.
25.
11.
Τάνεως] Tanis is the Greek name of Zoan, an oldand renowned cityin the Delta.
( 30 milesS.
W.
of Port Said), and thus nearer than the other principal cities to the frontier of Judah( Numb.
xiii.
22;
Ps.
lxxviii.
12).
The capital of the Hyksos.
οἱ σοφοὶ σύμβουλοι] The casus pendensis according to the Hebrew.
The wise men of Egyptare challenged, like the magicians in Moses' day(Exod.
vii.
11).
So the idols are challenged in xli.
23, the astrologers, xlvii.
13;
and any who profess to foretell or render void God's purpose( xliii.
9, xlv.
21, xlviii.
14,&c.
).
13.
ὑψώθησαν] Taking ABBREV,‘ are deceived,’ from ABBREV,‘ lift up,’ instead of ABBREV.
Μέμφεως] Heb.
Noph( Moph in Hos.
ix.
6).
The capital of the early dynastiesof Egypt,including the Pyramid- builders.
Psammetichus I.
fixed the capital there again.
Cairo is near the same site.
κατὰ φυλὰς] Heb.
‘ the cornerof her tribes’:
Scholz explains the discrepancy by referring to Exod.
xxvii.
12, Levit.
xiii.
41, where ABBREV, also=‘ corner,’ which he thinks was read by LXX.
here, is rendered κατά.
There is, however,a preposition in each case.
Perhaps LXX.
read ABBREV.
14.
αὐτοῖς] Heb.
has fem.
sing.
LXX.
again omits‘ the midst. ’
πλανήσεως] Heb.
rather‘ perverseness’:
diff.
word from xxix.
16.
pb 15.
ἀρχὴν καὶ τέλος] Heb.
‘ palm branch and rush,' cf.
ix.
14 17.
πᾶς ὃς ἄν.
.
.
φοβηθήσονται] The Heb.
is variously rendered, but some, as A.
V.
, have taken it substantially as LXX.
18.
A most difficult verse.
The number of‘ ﬁve cities' has never been explained, further thanasa small,but appreciable, number, which shall, if Egyptian, be turned tothe true God, or,if Jewish settlements, practise their religion in Egypt.
πάλη ἁσεδὲκ]In this phrase, andthe corresponding Hebrew, lies a special difficulty.
The Heb.
text has( City of)ha- heres,i.
e.
‘ of destruction,' which seems inconsistent with the apparent meaning of the verse.
Some explain it from Arabic haris, as‘of the Lion.
referring it to the temple built at Leontopolis by Onias IV.
, of the high priestly line, for the Jewish exiles in Egypt.
Others, again, reading with some MSS.
ABBREV for ABBREV read ha- heres,‘ of the sun'( civitas solis, Vulg.
), meaning HeliOpolis, or On, where was an important college of Egyptian priests.
The Lxx.
reading seems to have been ha- tzedek,‘ of righteousness,' quite unlikethe Heb.
( though see below), but giving an easier general sense.
With these data, Cheyne suggested that the original text was heres, referring to HeliOpolis:
which might have been altered by Jews in Egyptto tzedek,in support of the Leontopolis temple, by othersto heres,‘ destruction,’ in condemnationof it.
This, however,is somewhat complicated;
and Bp’s sturdy comment is worth recalling:
“ After all,I believe, that neither Onias, nor Heliopolis, nor Leontopolis, has anything to do with this subject" and Prof.
Skinner, whose note shouldbe carefully consulted, draws attentionto thefact, that, according to Josephus, itwasnot this, but the next verse, to which Onias referred.
( Aquila andTheodotionhave αρες, Symmachus ἡλίου.
) So far there is little satisfaction.
More recently, however,Mr F.
C.
Burkitt has pointed out that the reading ofℵ*, ασεδ ἡλίου καί, admits another explanation.
ἡλίου is clearlya duplicate.
) He therefore proposes to read ασεδ in Lxx.
, and in the Heb.
ABBREV ‘ mercy,’' lovingkindness,' for ABBREV This gives as easya sense as anything yet before us, and brings the mat.
and Heb.
into agreement.
The brilliance of the emendation cannot be denied:
if not certain, it is better than many emendations which are called so.
It is accepted by Prof.
W.
E.
Barnes in his recent edition of Isaiah(The Churchman's Bible).
Attention has already( note on iii.
10) been drawn to the numerous verbal resemblances between the Book of Wisdom and the Greek Isaiah.
It is at any rate an odd coincidence that brings together, in Wisd.
x.
6, 7, the words Πενταπόλεως and στήλη.
Several other words used in Isaiah occur in the chapter:
χέρσος, μνημόσυνον( Isa.
xxiii.
18), ἀσφαλίσασθαι( xli.
10), λάκκος( xxxvii.
16, notB), εὐσέβεια( xi.
2), τρανός( xxxv.
6).
19.
στήλη] Whether an actual obelisk is meant or not, the idea of a prominent landmark as a memorial is easy to understand, in Egypt of all countries.
It is to bea sign and witness, like Beth-e or Mizpah.
Any reference to the‘ pillars’of Canaanite idolatry, as in xvii.
8, seems ﬂatly impossible here.
20.
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα] As though pointed ABBREV instead of ABBREV' fora witness'( and ABBREV omitted).

ἄνθρωπον ὃς σώσει] Some refer this primarily to one of the Ptolemies, especially him who was surnamed Soter.
The language, however,is like that of various Messianic references.
And Egypt has undoubtedly received many blessings from Christianity.
After so many centuries, her state to- day is happier than many lands:
perhaps than any other part of Africa.

Prof.
Cheyne thinks this rendering, with whichthe Vulgate agrees,“ thoughtless”:
but if the‘ cruel lord' of ver.

See also ch.

ἐκκεκαλυμμένας]B's ἅμα, κεκαλυμμένους isprobablya corruption,based ona mistaken punctuation.
It is strange that printed editions continue to connect this participle with τὴν αἰσχύνην Αἰγύπτου.
5.
οἰ Αἰγύπτιοι°,°]B omits these words after ἡττηθέντες:
at their second occurrence the Heb.
has a preposition( lit.
‘ from’) preceding.
The Lxx.
have lost the syntax and with it the meaning.
ἦσαν γὰρ]Β reads οἱ ἦσαν, with the Lucianic MSS.
generally.
6.
Ἰδοὺ]Β precedes,in agreement with the Heb.
, with ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, which is apparently a Hexaplaric addition(* οἱ γ’Q mg).
οἳ οὔκ ἠδύναντο] The syntax again varies:
the negative in LXX may come from ABBREV before the infinitive:
but the rendering is wrong as well as loose;
cf.
with the Greek xlvi.

( The variations between θάλασσαν and ἔρημον, xvi.

are curious.
) Delitzsch 's note shouldbe consulted:
he applies the title to the sea- like desert surrounding Babylon, which was moreover subject to inundation:
and called the ‘ sea- land’by the monuments.
So Herod.
1, 184, πρότερον δὲ ἐώθεε ὁ ποταμὸς ἀνὰ τὸ πεδίον πᾶν πελαγίζειν.
Some modern critics, however, deny authority to this and similar titles.
Opinions differ, but mostcommentators refer this chapter to the fall of Babylon when taken by Cyrus:
some to an earlier siege in Isaiah's own time.
Of those who refer it to the time of Cyrus, many, denying that prophecymaybe expected to see into the far future in detail, attribute it toa later prophet about 540B.
C.
Those who do not seek to imposesuch limits, will hardly doubt Isaiah's authorship.
Ὡς.

διέλθοι] For διέλθοιQ* has merely θοι.
The clause must be comparative, see on xi.
9, xviii.
3.
It seems probable that the Optative mightbe used where, as here, Heb.
has infin.
with ABBREV with a kind of gerundial force.
The only other way to take the Greek would be as Oratio Obliqua, depending on ἀνηγγέλη:
and the meaning of Heb.
, and practice of the Lxx.
, seem decisive against this.
Jerome renders the Greek sicut.
.
.
transeat.
φοβερὸν is clearlya departure from the syntax of Heb.
ὁ ἀθετῶν ἀθετεῖ] Cf.
xxiv.
16, xxxiii.
1, xlviii.
8;
the root always emphatically repeated, and with the same parallel verbin xxxiii.
1.
Kay explains the Heb.
( rendered ‘ deal treacherously’ or thus:
“ the faithlessor unscrupulous man, who sets at nought the restraints of law, or the engagements he has himself made.
' ὁ ἀνομῶν ἀνομεῖ] Lxx.
seem here to have chosen a word of parallel sound to the preceding clause, at the costof exactness.
Heb.
‘ the spoiler spoileth' or‘ destroyer destroyeth.
' In xxxiii.
1, ταλαιπωρεῖν is used, transitively.
Without implicitly following what is laid down by Dr Hatch( Essay :
in Bibl.
Greek, pp.
22, 30,c.
) it may be said that Lxx.
do not alwayspreserve accurate distinctions among groups of words with somewhat similar meanings.
ἐπ’ ἐμοὶ] ABBREV takenby Lxx.
as ABBREV prepos.
and personal suffix.
instead of ABBREV imper.
of verb,‘ Go up.
' Even if we could take their rendering as equivalent toa battle cry,Α moi!the parallelism is against it.
Moreover, Lxx.
elsewhere read wrongly ABBREV‘I pray'as ἐν ἐμοὶ, quite againstthe sense:
Judg.

12.
οἱ πρέσβας] Reading ABBREV‘ besiege,’ imper.
, as ABBREV' messengers, παρακαλέσει] Heb.
‘I have made to cease':
Lxx.
may have attempted a paraphrase, or possibly taken ABBREV from ABBREV in sense of‘ refresh,’‘ restore. ’
παρακαλέω is a favourite word with the mat.
in Isaiah, to use in cases of doubt or difficulty:
cf.
x.
32, xxxviii.
16.
( See Vol.
1.
lntrod.
p.
50.
) 3.
ἠδίκησα] Heb.
is passive or ﬂexive( Niphal):
word meaning‘ to be crooked'or‘ bent,’so in active,‘ to do wrong.
'(' Perverse,and' wrong,' i.
e.
twisted, show the general prevalence of the metaphor contained in words of this sense.
τὸ μὴ ἀκοῦσαι.
.
.
τὸ μὴ βλέπειν]For τό,Β reads τοῦ before βλέπειν, and the Roman edition has it also before ἀκοῦσαι.
The MS.
support is, for τὸ μὴ ἀκοῦσαι RABQ 26 106 301Γe sil) τὸ μὴ βλέπειν ℵΑQΓ 26 49 97 106 301 The negatives evidently represent the Heb.
ABBREV ‘ from, ’ taken as having privative force.
ἐσπούδασα] Heb.
is again passive, as ἠδίκησα above:
word meaning‘ be terrified,'‘ cast down,' and in causal voice or aspect to‘ hasten.’
4.
ἡ ἀνομία με βαπτίζει] Heb.
‘ horror affrights me.
' The Lxx.
here reminds us of P5.
xxxviii.
4, 6, lxix.
2, but bears no resemblance tothe Heb.
They may possibly have read ABBREV for ABBREV ABBREV‘ breaking down,' the verb applied to overflowing of water, and to lawlessness:
cf.
1 Sam.
xxv.
10,‘ that break away every man from his master':
Lxx.
represents Perazim, xxviii.
21, by ἀσεβῶν).
For ABBREV perhaps they read ABBREV but the letters are not very near:
had they read any part of ABBREV καταπίνω would probably have been their word.
ἢ ἡ ψυχή] Clearly due to reading ABBREV for ABBREV ‘ twilight’ :
Lxx.
omit‘ of my desire,' perhaps because ABBREV bears something of the same meaning:
cf.
e.
g.
lvi.
11.
5.
τράπεζαν] After this Heb.
has‘ they setthewatch'( or acc.
to some,‘ they spread the carpets.
' Lxx.
omits this, but it was apparently supplied in the Hexapla and σκόπευσαν τὴν σκοπιὰν is found in 22 23 48 51 90 109 144 305 308(Q mg with*).
The Heb.
verbs are infin absolute, which maybe taken as equivalent to the imperative,or better,to a descriptive tense.
πίστι, φάγετε]So RAQ, with Heb.
:
B inverts the order.
ἑτοιμάσατε θυρεοὺς] Verb isanexplanatory version of Heb.
, which has‘ anoint the’( that blows might glance at? it).
So Virg.
Aen VII.
626,“ Pars leves clipeos et spicula lucida tergent Arvina pingui.
' 6.
The relation of the prophet to the‘ watchman’is interesting.
Generally, the prophetis himself the watchman:
as perhaps in ver.
11( diff.
Heb.
word), and clearly in Ezek.
iii.
17, xxxiii.
7, Habak.
ii.
I.
The best view seems to be that of Delitzsch, that the prophet“ divides himself into two ”:
seeing, and yet not himself directly seeing the vivid scene of the next verse.
He plays both parts, as in2 Sam.
xviii.
24, the watcheron the tower, and alsothe bearer below, making his comments.

ἀναβάτην] Heb.
is said to mean here‘a troop,' more probably than as AV.
‘ a chariot':
but the word often means' rider'so Vulg.
ascensorem.
In the vision, bands and bodies of men, variously equipped, make theirway across the plain.
ἀκρόασαι ἀκρόασιν πολλὴν] Heb.
repeats the root- word thrice:
‘ hearken with hearkening,a great hearkening.
8.
καὶ.
κάλεσον Οὐρείαν] Heb.
‘ and he cried( called)as a lion' cf.
Rev.
x.
3.
No more probable rendering is forthcoming.
Arieh.
‘a lion,' differs from Uriah onlyin vowel- points,and the insertionofa after initialℵ:
which also might have been expressed in vowel- points.
The translator probably thought of viii.
2.
Aquila has λέοντα, Symm.
λέαιναν, Vulg.
leo, Theod.
ἀριήλ, which Prof.
W.
E.
Barnes revives.
If the prophecy be Isaiah's, Uriah's presence asa witness would not be in itself impossible:
but it cannot be said that that reading would make the sentence much easier.

B and the Luc.
MSS.
(e sil.
) have astop after σκοπιάν, followed by Κύριος εἶπεν, which hardly givesa probable sense.
In any case, the syntax of the Heb.
is lost.
διὰ παντὸς ἡμέρας καὶ.

ὃλην τὴν νύκτα] We are remindedof the watchmanin Aeschylus, Agamemnon( which Alb.
Barnes quotes) 2 foll.

more exactly:

butB is alone,or nearly 50, among theGk MSS.
in doubling it.
In Rev.

some MSS.
however, including C andB( not the great Vatican MS.

Apart from the questions ofthe date and authorshipof ver.
1— 10,it isa doubtful point among commentators whether the following verses contain companion prophecies to the ﬁrst.
In themselves theyare hardly supposedto contain any clear indication of their date or occasion.
τῆς Ἰδουμαίας] Heb.
Dumah,‘ silence,’ usually interpretedas standing for Edom.
The resemblance of the Greek word must be regarded asa coincidence, in the present state ofour knowledge, though the interpretation stands as correct.
Dumah appears in Gen.

Tema, like Kedar and Dumah,ason of Ishmael, seems to have given his name toa place onthe road between Damascus and Mecca.
Delitzsch distinguishes a second placeof the name.
Teman was a grandson of Esau.
The subject of these Arabian tribes is obscure.
Possibly tribes originally of Ishmaelite and of Keturaite descent coalesced with Hamitic stocks;
and may also have been joined by some descendantsof Esau.

“ Sept.
is lucid but very different," Prof.
Cheyne says.
The syntax differs;
the repeated διὰ τὸ πλῆθος·
is apparently an attempttoexplain and enforcethe Heb.
ABBREV‘ from the face of,' and so almost=‘ because of,' followed twiceby ABBREV‘ sword,’ which may have been misread as 31,‘ multitude,’ or( in plur.
) as ABBREV‘ abundance.’
The ﬁrst clausein the Lxx.
seems to come from the verb‘ they ﬂed’ of Heb.
:
φευγόντων of ℵAQ seems therefore preferable to πεφονευμένων ofB, and the next clause with πλανωμένων is possiblya duplicate:
the second clause relating to the‘ drawn sword'is dropped in Lxx.
:
the next agrees with Heb.
, and the last must bea misreading or misunderstandingof ABBREV‘ weight.’
πεδίῳ, the alteration of the corrector ofΑ, has littleto recommend it.
[ 6.
Lxx.
omits ‘ all’ before glory, and inserts' sons.
XXII.
1— 14.
The exact occasion of this prophecy is and its date also.
Many place it in 701, some earlier:
it seems to refer to some relief of the city from threatening pressure by the Assyrians, and expresses the’s strong disapprovalof the’s attitude.
Verses 15 — 25, on Shebna, must be earlier Sennacherib's dispatch of Rabshakeh, as not Shebna, but Eliakim, is then' over the house 1.
ὅραμα] ℵBQ read ῥῆμα.
τῆς φάραγγος Σιὼν] Heb.
‘ of thevalleyof vision,' ABBREV Lxx.
may have interpreted or guessed, or may have misread it as ABBREV;
but this last seems unlikely, as the phrase recurs in ver.
5.
One of the ravines or valleys round Jerusalem seems to be enough to account for the phrase, though we usually think of the city more asa mountain fortress.
Kay and Birks, alone among modern commentators, apply the passage and description to Samaria.
It can scarcely be accepted, but the former's note( in the Speaker's Comm.
) should be consulted.
Τί ἐγίνετό σοι] So the Heb.
, except that no verb is expressed.
δόματα] Heb.
word means definitely' roofs.
μάταια] Heb.
' tunmult' ABBREV from root ABBREV which is explained in the sense of ABBREV‘ vanity.’
This word belongs in the Heb.
to ver.
2.

βοώντων] Heb.
has an abstract word, and Lxx.
omits the parallel phrase‘a jubilant town.
' ἡ πόλις ἀγαυριῶσα, ἀγαυριῶσα,Q mgV and Luc.
enigma] Heb.
word, generally thus rendered in LXX.
, strictly means‘ pierced’or‘ wounded,’ but, in practice, is said to be used of the slain, mortally stricken.
Lxx.
inserts οἱ νεκροί σου, balancing the clauses.
μαχαίρας.

πολέμου] So most MSS.
:
butB has ἐν μαχαίραις πολέμῳ( Rom.

3.
καὶ οἱ ἁλόντες] Perhaps ABBREV‘ together,’ read as ABBREV( cf.
xiv.
10), taking theD from the following word.
σκληρῶς] Heb.
‘ without( lit.

vowel- points).
Omitting D, see letters are ABBREV which LXX.

12.
δεδεμένοι]’s δεδεγμένοι can scarcely be other thana’s error.
οἱ ἰσχύοντες] Scholz explains this as ABBREV read for the second ABBREV‘ are made’:
perhaps rather ABBREV is the corresponding Heb.
to οἱ ἷσχύοντες ἐν σοὶ, and was misread by transposition, omitting ABBREV ABBREV or, by sound, Tum, either giving the required meaning.
( The most likelywords to be omittedby Lxx.
are ABBREV ABBREV as both have occurred in the verse already.

” AΦετέ με]‘ Let mego’:
probably a paraphrase, for Heb.
‘ look away from’ verb ABBREV;

ταραχῆς καὶ ἀπωλείας καὶ καταπατήματος] 50 all MSS.
but B καταπάτημα).
ΑΒ agree against ℵ*Q* inadding καὶ πλάνησις, which is found inQ mg, but seems probably right.
As compared with Heb.
, which has three words of similar form and vowel sounds, καὶ ἀπωλείας seems to be the intrusive phrase in Lxx.
, the other three translating Heb.
fairly well:
for πλάνησις, cf.
Exod.

Mr H.

7.
ἔσονται] ἔσται would have corresponded with Heb.
:
but the verb was probably made plural, because of φάραγγες immediately following.
8.
άνακαλύψουσιν] Lxx.
continues the plural, and the fut.
tense, losing the effect of Heb.
, which has sing.
and impf.
with υαυ con- versive, indicating somewhatofa transition here.
πύλας] Possibly an explanation of Heb.
‘ covering,’ or‘ curtain’’ as ofa fortress,but see below.
ἐκλακτοὺς οἴκους] Heb.
corresponding to ἐκλεκτοὺς is ABBREV‘ weapons.
Lxx.
may have misread or not known the word.
Somewhat resembling it is the formnzciz, used in Nehemiah( xiii.

);
the last consonant of the root differs, but thedifference is perhaps not beyond the possi- bility of confusion.
This word stands for a chamber attached to the Temple.
τῆς πόλεως]i.

ABBREV ‘ City’ for ABBREV‘ forest.’
The‘ house of the forest’ is probably the‘ house houseof the forestof’built by Solomon, and used as an armoury:

ἀνακαλύψουσιν] in the Heb.
, the verb of which comes later, and isrepresented by εἴδοσαν.
It may be simply repeated from ver.
8;
but it is suspicious that three words, πύλας, ἐκλεκτοὺς, ἀνακα- λύψουσιν, each unwarrantedbythe Hebrew,are found rightly used just above at this point.
It looks asif the’s ora’s eye had repeatedly strayed backward at some stagein the historyofthe text,or the lines been disordered.
οἴκων, just below, may bea fourth instance.
τὰ τὰ κρυπτὰ] Probablya paraphrase,to suit ἀνακαλύψουσιν, for‘the’:
ἄκρας expresses ‘ the’ with an addedbut appropriate touch;

καὶ τὸ κράτος] So ℵAQ 24 26 41 51 87 91 97 106 301 309 κατὰ κράτος, Βc.

καὶ τοῖς ἐνοικοῦσιν ἐν Ἰούδᾳ] Heb.
‘ and tothehouse of Judah’:
but QΓ 301 omit τοῖς ἐνοικοῦσιν, andΑ* the whole clause.
22.
From this verse, as given by A, QΓ 24 198 306 omit all after ἀντιλέγων, Β admittingthe last clause, in theform καὶ κλείσει καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ ἀνοίγων.
Field and Ceriani agree in approving the text as givenbyQ, with which the Syro- hexaplar agrees:
thinking thatthe fuller reading, which duplicates the reading ofQ in verbal accordance with Aq.
Theod.
Symm.
and with the Hebrew, is Hexaplaric.
( See Vol.
1.
Introd.
p.
31.
) Β's last clauseis pretty clearly inconsistent with the rest of its reading, and points to some confusion or inadvertence on the part of the scribe, who seems to have had both readings before him.
ℵ has been repeatedlycorrected:
its original text agrees very nearly with the Heb.
A combines, practically, the readings ofQ and ofℵ*.
The evidence of the Syro- hexaplar,and the intrinsic character of’s text,a terse paraphrase, makes it almost certain that the viewof Field and Ceriani is right.’
s view,that the sentence as given byQ is an“ Unrichtige Erklarung desF Folgenden,” seems not to due account of the textual problem of the LXX.
) The Lucianic Mss.
show further variants, some reading καὶ οὐδεὶς·
κλείσει forκ.
οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἀποκλείσων.
It seems as though the quotation in Rev.

στήσω]Β and Qmg have στηλῶ.

word( occurs again,ver.
25, ἐστηριγμένος)is represented by στῆσαιin Gen.

The difficulty in this verse is well known, whether it is to be taken as returning to the subject of Shebna, or foretelling the turn of Eliakim to fall also.
On the whole, probably the latter:

24 to some extent leads up to ver.
25.
ὁ) To- apply the simile of the peg ﬁrstto Eliakim,then to Shebna, would be strange.
( c) To return for one verseto8.

(d) Eliakim may havebeen personally faulty, and his relatives also, for anything thatis said.
Lowth, Gesenius, Ewald, and W.
E.
Barnes refer the verse, how- ever,to Shebna:
Delitzsch, Cheyne, Skinner,to Eliakim;
also Kay, who endeavoursto avoid the last objection.
πεσεῖται καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται]Β inverts these verbs, and adds καὶ ἐξολεθρευθήσεται, which byQ mg appears to come from Theodotion.

It is agreed that Heb.
Chittim is Cyprus( Citium,a Phoenician trading- port on theS.

According to the Heb.
, the ships, on arrival at Cyprus, or beforetouching there, learn the newsofa disaster to Tyre:
which is variously explained as its overthrow byN ebuchadnezzar, or an earlier siege by Shalmaneser or by Sennacherib, who appears to have ravaged Phoe- nicia so that the king of Zidon ﬂedto Cyprus( cf.

I cannot seeany real distinction of sense in the way that the sing.

text, that istosay an errorinreading by the translator, or at any ratea very early scribe.
Β * and the Luc.
Mss.
generally agree with the later versions in reading Σιδῶνος.
As the difference in Greek includes the presence or not of the genitive termination, it is reasonable to suppose that the mistake was made in reading from the Heb.
, the phrase‘ daughter of’ being familiar.
Lxx.
omit‘ virgin.’
Yet,as Kay pointsout, the original Heb.

πόλις also agrees with Heb.
text in its actual wording, while πόλεις would differ in number;
though this is probably of little weight.
εἰς τὸ ἀρχαῖον] Probably‘to her ancient’ the neuter adj.

B, with Theodotion, adds at the end of the verse ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς;
Hexaplaric and the Luc.

insert πάσης.
18.
The verse isa puzzling onein the original, and has hardly been fully explained.
In some way the restored Tyre is to be dedi- cated to the Lord;
her commerce is to help the wayof religion,or profit those who help it;
her fits are not to be idly stored up and meet the fate of destruction without having served some useful purpose.
Lxx.
treat with some freedom, omitting‘nor stored’and the substantive verb‘ shall’) inthenext clause, thus alteringthe syntax.
On the otherhand, αὐτοῖς, πᾶσα, and καὶ πιεῖν καὶ.

are inserted:

πανταχῇ] More generalthan Heb.

the streets, or the ﬁelds outside the city.
The two latter clauses of the verse are merged by Lxx.
in one:
or ifB, with 22 23 24 36 48 51 62 87 90 93 97 109 144 147 228 305, is right in omitting τῆς γῆς, the later clause is omitted entirely.
This is probable, as the array of cursives against RAQ is unusually strong, though not including 26 106 or 301.
In this case πέπαυται may representa misreading of may as may( so Govett), 12.
The syntax varies in the former clause:
in the latter onlya general resemblanceis preserved:

have either misread or guessed:
τὸ ὕδωρ is also inserted, as if ABBREVhad been readfor οὐ,‘ from the’ πραχθήσεται perhaps from reading ABBREV from ABBREV or some form from ABBREV instead of ABBREV).
15.
The verse has been recast, and ABBREV‘in the lights,’ omitted, almost certainly owing to confusion with ABBREV ἐν τοῖς νήσοις, following.
Some,.
as Lowth, have wishedto read DMD in both places:
but he was misled by the two MSS.

The order of clauses inB follows the Heb.
, whereas inNAQit differs,the Heb.
clauses being arranged as follows:
the verbs of a andb come ﬁrst, then the comparisons:
then clause d, and lastlyc, witha γὰρ which seems less natural in’s order.
Fourteen cursives support RAQ in the former, and twenty- four inthe latter part of the verse.
21.
τοῦ οὐρανοῦ] Heb.
‘ of the heightinthe’ Cf.
Eph.
vi.
12, ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις.
Lxx.
omits‘ in the’ and the corre- sponding‘on the earth'( or,‘ ground’).
22.
NAQ again vary from the Heb.
order, with modification of syntax;
B retains it, with insertion of συναγωγὴν αὐτῆς;
συναγωγὴν corresponds to the Heb.
noun after its kindred verb:
but αὐτῆς is awkward, γῆς beingthe only noun to which it can refer.
RAQ are supported by 41 49 87 91 97 106 195 228 301 306 309( 26 partly).
23.
τακήσεται] Heb.
‘ shall blush':
parallel to‘ be ashamed'in i.
29, where LXX.
does not distinguish.
Here Scholz, following Schleusner, suggests that LXX.
read man( from ABBREV instead of man.
Or more probably their rendering depends on their mistake in the following words, as πεσεῖται seems to do:
else we might conjecture that they read than( xxix.
22).
πλίνθος] Heb.
‘ the moon,' ABBREV also, with one changeof pointing, ABBREV has this meaning of‘ brick’:
both senses from the root meaning‘ white.’
From this the whole divergence of the verse seems to arise.
τεῖχος] Reading non ‘ sun’ as ABBREV‘ wall.’
These words for‘ sun’ and‘ moon’are poetic in tone;
they are rightly rendered by LXX.
in xxx.
26.
The correct rendering of Heb.
, from Symmachus, appears asa duplicate inℵ*Q mg, most Luc.
MSS.
( exc.

‘ 3, probably rightly rendered here:
means either‘ for,’‘ that,’ or‘ when.’
XXV.
I.
Θεός μου]Β omits μου, and LXX.
generally omit‘ thou’( art).
ἀρχαίαν] Rightly interpreted:
Heb.
literally ‘ from’( of time or place).
ἀληθινήν·
γένοιτο] Heb.
has two kindred words,‘ truth,’ true.
LXX.
translates the ﬁrst rightly, except that it is rather to be taken as subst.
than adj.
, while the second they took to be the familiar asse.
‘‘ verily,’‘ Amen’;
so Vulg.
, but Heb.
text points it differently here.
Κύριε] Not in Heb.
, but B is alone or nearly so in omitting it.
It is frequently inserted in this and the following chapter.
2.
τοῦ πεσεῖν] Paraphrase of Heb.
‘ ruin. ’
B inserts μὴ, some scribe having taken it as an explanationof ὀχυράς.
τῶν ἀσεβῶν] Heb.
‘ strangers,’ often used in a bad sense:
a“ general term for the enemies of’s people," Delitzsch says.
It is not the same word as in Ps.
xviii.
44, 45( Lowth thought LXX.
had read ABBREV for ABBREV;
cf.
Deut.
xvii.
13, ἀσεβήσει, and xviii.
20, 22).
πόλις] Α, with ℵ cb, actually reads πόλεις;
this variation is of little importancein itself,see on xxiii.
16;
but it is possible that εἷς has dropped out after πόλις:
ℵ ca insertsit.
LXX.
have apparently omitted the preposition before‘ city,’ τὸ θεμέλια corresponding to‘ castle’ in the order.
In the Heb.
the prepos.
has the same force as in xvii.
l, xxiii.
I.
3.
ὁ πτωχὸς] Reading ABBREV‘ poor’for ABBREV‘ strong’( Scholz).
ἀδικουμένην] Here andinver.
4 the Lxx.
have chosen to usea passive participle, probably misled by their view of the context.
This Heb.
verb is not passively used, but Lxx.
, with no vowel- pointing to guide them, may not have known this.
They generally render it with active sense, or by sucha word as ὑπερήφανος;
see xiii.
H, xxix.
5.
εὐλογήσουσίν σε] The verbis repeated, instead of the Heb.
parallel.
4.
βοηθὸς] The Lxx.
seem to have been confused here.
The word for‘ stronghold.
' ABBREV occurring twice, seems to have beenmis- read, ﬁrst as ABBREV‘ city,’ and thenasABBREV‘ help. ’
ταπεινῇ is right;
πασῇ may be due to reading it againas ABBREV before the ﬁrst ABBREV.
The total effect of LXX.
's misreadings would thus be ABBREV‘ 1) 535 for ABBREVABBREV ABBREV.
ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων πονηρόν]It may be supposed that upto this point the Greek corresponds sufficiently well with Heb.
Here divergence begins again LXX.
Lxx.
probably reading ABBREV‘ from strangers,' see ver.
2, instead of ABBREV‘ from the storm.’
ῥύσῃ αὐτοὺς] Probably ABBREV‘ shadow,' guessed or read as some part of ABBREV‘ deliver':
perhaps Hiphil impf.
ABBREV withD from the beginning of the next word possibly read as 3 pl.
pronoun object- termination.
σκέπη] Either repeated from previous clause, or a duplicate rendering of ABBREV but in the latter case it stands for two different words in the verse.
διψώντων] This, and διψῶντες in ver.
5, appear to stand for Heb.
‘ heat,'‘ drought.
καὶ πνεῦμα] Heb.
has not‘ amd,’ but ABBREV‘ for.’
The word translated‘ blast’is the ordinary wordfor‘ spirit’or‘ breath’:
and with ἀδικου- μένων, as in ver.
3, Lxx.
have given a different turn to the meaning.
εὐλογήσουσίν σε] Repeated bya slip from ver.
3 after ἀδικουμένων Β omits,but it is found in RAQW 24 26 36 48 49 87 91 97 106 228 309.
5.
ὥς ἄνθρωποι] Again is difficult to reconcile with Heb.
;
ABBREV from the end of previous verse may have been read as ABBREV and ὀλιγόψυχοι suggests ABBREV which may have been the ABBREV attempt to read ABBREVIt would, however,be generally followed by ABBREV in this sense:
see Exod.
vi.
9.
( Or if ἄνθρωποιwerean addition of LXX.
, ABBREV might have been read as ABBREV and ABBREV as ABBREV‘ deﬁcient’or ABBREV‘ failing.
" ἐν Σιὼν] Heb.
here differs from ‘ Zion’ in pointing, and means‘a parched’:
Lxx.
renders it Σιὼν also in xxxii.
2, its only other occurrence.
Words from the sameroot occur, xiii.
21, xxxiv.
14‘ desert creatures,' and Job xxiv.
19 ‘ drought.
οἷς ἡμᾶς παρέδωκας] Assuming that ἀπὸ ἀνθ.
ἀσεβῶν represents either ABBREV or ABBREV we have about six Heb.
words to account for, and this clause bears no perceptible resemblance to any of them.
LXX.
, after being in difficulties for some time, fall back on their favourite παραδίδωμι;
cf.
xxiii.
7.
Their MSS.
may have been illegible at this point;
but it will be noticed that passages with the same words recurring constantly are apt to reduce themto helplessness.
6.
Lxx.
again shortens considerably;
and though the translator appears confused by repetitions in the Heb.
, the possibility of inten- tional shortening must not be entirely overlooked.
ἐπὶ το ὅρος] Either the force of acc.
with prep.
is lost,=‘ they shallgo to this mountain to drink.

χρίσονται μύρον] The two preceding phrases read like a short- ening of the rest of ver.

;
though 53 might have been read in duplicate as ABBREV but it looks like a scribe ' s would- be improvement, taking the form of many pronouncements of the Law( Lev.
xviii.
29, c.
) The syntax again differs from Heb.
, and there are further dis- crepancies.
ἀλήθειαν apparently correspondsto‘ uprightness,’ which is here not ABBREV but a word used in xxx.
10;
lvii.
2 is closely akin, and the passages should be compared in Lxx.
:
note ἀρθήτω, ἦρται( perhaps some form fromrm read for ABBREV and in that casea duplicate here).
ὁ ἀσεβὴς seems to stand in the place of the verb ABBREV‘ will deal unjustly. ’
11.
ᾔδεισαν, γνόντες] Heb.
has same word, meaning‘ see’(i.
1 xxx.
IO, c.
) rather than‘ know. ’
λήμψεται, ἀπαίδευτον] These words are added by Lxx.
, giving a new colour to the sentence.’
s suggestion, apparently,is that they read ppm δι’ ἀπαιδευσίαν, Hosea vii.
16) after ABBREV‘ people.

cf.
ver.
13, where Β* omits Κύριε ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν.
πάντα.
ἀπέδωκας ἡμῖν] Heb.
‘ hast wrought all our works for’ LXX.
's rendering erhaps comes from the use of the noun correspond- ing to the verb 175 here used,to mean‘ wages,’‘ reward’of work.
See xl.
Io, xlix.
4, lxii.
11;
cf.
Levit.

13.
13.
Lxx.
has again different syntax, altering the sense consider- ably:
2 pers.
sing.
imperat.
for 3rd pers.
plur.
perf.
, of verb, and ‘ lords’ rendered asa vocative. ’
κτῆσαι] The Heb.
verb is connected with Baal‘ lord’).
Cf.
the very different rendering in lxii.
5.
The converse of this verse may be seenin iii.
18;
but the verb, both in Heb.
and Gr.
, is different.
ἄλλσ οὐκ οἴδαμεν] Heb.
has‘ only by’:
ἄλλον may represent ABBREV only, in the sense of‘ separate’:
οὐκ may be‘ 13 readas 52.
We are thenleft with οἴδαμεν, τὸ ὄνομά σου ὀνομάζομεν, to represent ABBREV Ἴων).
The noun is obvious, but which of the two verbs does ABBREV stand for? As the verb and noun in Heb.
are not kindred, and as the order of words is generally followedby LXX.
, there isa presumption that οἴδαμενstandsfor it, and ὀνομάζομεν isa supplement in the Creek.
The meaning of the Heb.
verb is not οἶδα but μιμνήσκω,‘ remember.
‘ call to’:
but LXX.
may have read it as ABBREV( Piel),‘ recognise,’‘ acknowledge.
With ver.
13, 14, there shouldbe compared Aesch.
Again.
168 foll.
, which represents an idea as near to’s asadevout heathen warrior could compass:
14.
ζωὴν οὐ μὴ ἴδωσιν] Heb.
simply‘ shall not live.’
The Greek seems to combine the two ideas foundin Ps.
xxxiv.
8 and in xxxvi.
9.
ἰατροὶ] Heb.
Rephaim:
see on xiv.
9.
Here rendered by most‘ shades,’ but referred by some( esp.
Prof.
W.
E.
Barnes) to the old inhabitants ofthe land,“ once greatly feared, but extinct in Isaiah’s day.
” Ver.
ι8, 19 may be thought to favour this idea;
on the other hand xiv.
9 and Ps.
lxxxviii.
1O are against it.
LXX.
, with their mistaken renderingof the word, have proceeded to take‘ rise’as causal:
ℵ* however seems to have read ἀναστήσονται.
ἐπήγαγες] Generally with τὴν χεῖρα, to render Heb.
ABBREV‘ visit,’‘ set over’:
so xxiv.
21,&c.
;
but cf.
x.
12.
πᾶν ἄρσιν] Heb.
‘ all their memory’:
or,‘ every memorial.’
Two meaningsare assigned tothe root( or roots) ABBREV(a) to remember, call to mind:
( b) to bea male.
15.
πρόσθη.
.
.
κακὰ] Heb.
‘ thou hast added to the nation’( twice).
The insertion of κακὰ bythe LXX.
may be due to a misreading of ABBREV which does not appear in the Greek otherwise:
or it maybedue to interpretation, implying a meaning as in chap.
xv.
9, ‘ more, ’ lit.
‘ additions’;
possibly also in Ps.
cxx.
3.
The rest of the verse is shortened by the omission of‘ thou’ hast enlarged all the borders’ supplied, doubtless froma later version, inV 109 305(* Q mg).
τοῖς ἐνδόξοις seems to correspond to the verb ‘ hast gotten thee glory.’
Scholz, however, thinks ἐνδόξοις represents ABBREV‘ princes’ for ABBREV‘ borders’:
and the resemblance is certainly close.
There seem to be tracesofa duplicate rendering in the text.
16.
ἐμνήσην] Heb.
3rd per.
plur.
:
the sense here is not far from the Heb.
verb, which is more properly‘ inquired for’:
ABBREV usual meaning‘ visit. ’
ἐν θλίψει μικρᾷ] The previous θλίψει was correct for Heb.
ABBREV Here Heb.
has‘ they poured out’ ABBREV which mightbe similarly translated, taking it from ABBREV‘be in distress,’ though itis not impos- sible that LXX.
read ABBREV again.
μικρᾷ stands in the corresponding place to ABBREV‘a’:
perhaps reading 29511, translated ἀδύνατος·
in Joel iii.
10, and cf.
the transposition in xiv.
12:
or possibly ABBREV‘ failure.
17.
τῷ ἀγαπητῷ σου] Nothing appears in the Heb.
text to correspond to these words.
18.
διὸ, τὸν Φόβον σου] Heb.
( ver.
17)‘ at thy’:
lit.
‘ from thy’ often used in connection with fear:
cf.
ii.
10, 19, and Psalm lxxvi.
7.
καὶ ἐτέκομεν.
πνεῦμα σωτηρίας σου ἐποιήσαμεν] If we placethestop after πνεῦμα, the sentence resembles the Heb.
more nearly, as accented7and interpreted.
Grabe supplied οὐ tothe Greek text, which is other- wise in direct contradictionto the Hebrew:
and if we suppose that σωτηρίας οὐ ποίησομενwasthe original LXX.
, we have only the re- peated ς, the ε, and changeofο toa, which would follow asa matter of course,to explain, as probable corruptions.
πεσοῦνται] The Heb.
word here, and its causal form at the end of the next verse( rendered intrans.
, πεσεῖται) are takenbysome commen- tators of comingandbringing to the birth.
It is not so used elsewherein the Bible, but similar uses of corresponding words are found( see Prof. ’

XXVII.
Though hitherto in this section there has been little specific mention of the surrounding nations, it is evident that they are symbolically referredto here.
The questions are, how many creatures are spoken of, and, according tothe number, which nations they represent.
If one, it is most likely Egypt:
if two, Assyria and Egypt:
if three, Assyria- Babylon( Leviathan undertwo aspects), and Egypt.
From the LXX.
it would perhaps be thought that only one was spokenof:
but the Hebrew suggests two, at any rate, and this idea is strengthenedbya comparison of Ezek.
, esp.
xvii.
and xxxi.
, and by the consideration of’s position betweentwo greater powers.
Then Ezek.
xxiii.
tends to show that Babylonmaybe regarded asarenewed and modified formofthe Assyrian power, and the double description of Leviathan is thus accounted for.
Delitzsch explains the ‘ ﬂeeing’ or‘ﬂeet’ serpentasemblematic of Ninevehonthe“ arrowy” and the‘coiled’ or‘crooked’of Babylon on the winding Euphrates.
The dragon, for Egypt, is referred to in li.
9, cf.
Ezek.

and Ps.

ἐπιθύμημα] Reading as do some Heb.
MSS.
, ABBREV ‘ desire’ for sun‘ wine’( foaming):
καλός preceding looks like a duplicate of more general meaning.

generally with acc.
of the song, but also absolutely, as Pind.
Nam.
11.
40, ἁδυμελεῖδ’ ἐξάρχετε φωνᾷ.
3.
πολιορκουμένη] Perhaps another interpretation of verb ‘ guard,’ or readas from a kindred word.
πόλις, which takes the place of the Divine Name, may bea guess, and πόλις ἰσχυρὰ a duplicate.
μάτην] Perhaps ABBREV‘ in vain’read for ABBREV‘ every moment. ’
ἁλώσεται] Corresponds in placeto‘ hurt,’ but withthevoice changed:
‘ night’ and‘day’ are separatedin their clauses, and πεσεῖται looks likea guess, the root‘I will keep’having the confusing letters ABBREV again.
τεῖχος] Belongs in the Heb.
to the nextverse, being obviously ABBREV for ABBREV‘ heat’( of anger,&c.
):
cf.
xxiv.
23, whence perhaps πεσεῖται.
Some authorities have approved the reading here of LXX.
, making it the vineyard that speaks,‘I have( there is to me)no wall,’ τεῖχος οὐκ ἔστιν.
4.
ἥ οὐκ ἐπελάβετο αὐτῆς] Heb.
has only‘ to me, ’ see previous note, so that this clause is practically an addition of LΧΧ.
The whole passage is exceedingly obscure, and the translator, not unnaturally, in difﬁculties.
, φυλάσσειν] ABBREV‘to watch’for ABBREV‘ briers’:
καλάμην is sufﬁciently near to‘ thorns’:
ἐν ἀγρῷ is an addition on the part of LΧΧ.
, or perhapsa duplicate, based ona misreading ofthefollowing word‘in battle,’ which διὰ τὴν πολεμίαν seems to represent.
ἠθέτηκα] Reading‘I would march against it’ from ABBREV‘ rebel,’ constructed with ABBREV cf.
i.
2:
instead of ABBREV.
κατακέκαυμαι] This seemsto correspond with‘I would burn it’:
the preceding words, τοίνυν.

LΧΧ.

8.
μαχόμενος] Heb.
hasa curious form, which isby some thought to be a reduplication of the word seak,a measure:
hence,‘ by measure- measure,’ i.
e.
in moderation, or, in exact measure.
Others render,‘byaffrighting her,' or‘ driving her forth.’
Scholz considers that not.
read, byamistake of sound, mm for memo:
cf.
Habak.
ii.
7;
he further gets an equivalent for ὀνειδίζων from the ﬁnaln anda supposed repetitionofw:
from the beginning of the next word.
This however seems scarcely satisfactory:
perhaps Lxx.
thought of one of the difficult words on, ABBREV xi.
IO, lix.

ἐξαποστελῶ] Heb.
‘ by( or, when) sending her’:
cf.
xvi.
8.
οὗ σὺ ἦσθα.
ὅ pansy] The syntaxis altered, and‘ thou contendest bears no apparent relation to οὐ σὺ ἦσθα.

See below.
ὅτι οὗ μὴ προέλθῃ]B omits οὐ.
It is on the face of it easiest to regard this omission as a clerical error.
On the other hand,the next clause, beginning ver.
18, μὴ καὶ ἀφέλῃ, gives some support toB's text, if it can be translated.
The use of μή, in this case, appears to be elliptic( Goodwin, Gr.
Μ.
and T.

Plat.

21.
The difficulty is, that in these and similar passages, the ellipse amounts in practice to a qualifiedand cautious assertion, whereas here the assertion seems to be of full strength:
and μὴ καὶ ἀφέλῃisnot necessarily the same constructionas the previous clause.
The Lxx.
has certainly broken loose to some extent from the Heb.
, and the construction is rather broken:
and μὴ καὶ ἀφέλῃ certainlyseems to mean,‘ see lest it take’ Either then, ὅτι οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃmay explain ψεύδεα‘ ye who vainly trust in a lying idea that the tempest will not pass over you, see that it take not away.
.
.
and( certainly) your hope will not’ This involves taking παρέλθῃ as practically equivalent to ἐπέλθῃ, which is not free from objection, though see ver.
15, 19.
The only other course, apparently,is to takethe words ὅτι οὐ μὴ.
.
.
ἐμείνῃ as a simple parenthesis:
‘ for the tempestshallnot pass youby:
take heed lest it even take away your covenantof death, and,& c.’
It is possible, that if ὅτι οὐ μὴ isthetrue text, the scribe ofB or’s predecessor might havedroppedthe οὐ,underthe influence of the following clause.
παρέλθῃ.
.
.
καταιγὶς] καταιγὶς is probably mum read as a noun, or confused with ABBREV ver.
15.
παρέλθῃ seems to correspondto ABBREV‘ hiding’ akin to the verb which σκεπασθησόμεθα renders at the end of ver.
15.
The relation of meaning is not very obvious:

nothing at all resemblingthe Heb.
letters having this meaning, and in the rest of the verse only συναχθῆναι, in a vagueand general way, has the same meaning as Heb.
ABBREV but the sense ofthe clause,as pre- sented,is quite different.

It may also, however, occur on comparisonof xiv.
9 ἐπικράνθη), that πικρία may be due to some confusion with ABBREV earlier in the verse which is not rendered impossible by the rendering θυμοῦ there, as mu.

word by two Greek ones, and vice warm:
θυμὸς in this very verse can hardly stand for the same Heb.

) That the thrice- repeated‘ work’ of Heb.
is represented only once or twice will cause no surprise, after whatwe have seenofthe LXX.
's methods.
As to the Greek, ἀλλοτρίως(a) and ἀλλοτρία ὁ) evidently represent ABBREV‘ alien. ’
For the rest, in(a) θυμὸς is probably marread as man,from ABBREV‘pass over,'‘ exceed,’ used of‘ anger,’ as in Gen.
xlix.
7, μῆνις.
χρήσεται is eitheracolourless verb tocompletethe clause,or is’ intended to representa verbal form from ABBREV rightly read.
In( b) πικρία is perhaps dueto the same misreading as θυμὸς in(a), as ABBREV( Job iii.
20) is rathertoofar off in letterstobea probable misreading. ’
s σαπρία is difficult to account for, if more than the aberration of a scribe:
a misunderstanding of πικρία,a desperate attempt to get light from Joe] ii.
20 or Job xxi.
25, 26, or a reading of’ nv, Joel i.
17, as a noun, in place of ABBREV arealike unsatisfactory suggestions, and only mentioned in the hope of attracting the notice of some one who may perchance solve the enigma.
It is curious that in Eph.

and there AQ* 26 106 109 305 omit, and later hands have obelized in NB the superfluous words ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν.

A seems to have rearranged the particles in this verse;
the scribe perhaps objected to τότε, overlooking its relation to ὅταν, and thinkingit did not suit the first sowing described.
Similarly, not seeing thatthe sentence was interrogative, he cancelledthe οὐχ.
In this point the Luc.

βρωθήσεται then answers,but incorrectly,to ‘ is’ which is an imperfect( future)tense in Heb.

It is possible, however, that LXX.
guessed at the sense, and meant μετὰ ἄρτου to render ‘ witha staff,' according to the familiar saying:

συναγάγετε γενήματα] Taking the verb wrongly from ABBREV‘ gather’ instead ofABBREV‘ add,’ Lxx.

φάγεσθε γὰρ σὺν Μωάβ] This strange phrase bears no resemblance to Heb.
, except the connection between Φαγέσθε and‘ feasts.’
The Luc.
MSS.
supplya Hexaplaric rendering, ἑορταὶ συγκρουσθήσονταιand the LXX.
text doubtless professes to translate these same words.
The Old Latin is here extant in the VViirzburg fragment, beginning with the words manducate’ tz’: ’
m cum Μοab.
This sup- ports’s text which repeats φάγεσθε;
so also does’s rendering of the Lxx.
:
and it is noteworthy that both treat the ﬁrst φάγεσθεas imperative.
Of this imperat.
middle there are some possible instances elsewherein Lxx.
, e.

30, but perhapsnonewhich are certainly imperative.
As to σὺν Μωάβ, there are two questions.
What is the meaningor reference?Is it the original Lxx.
text?To the ﬁrst, several attempts at an answermightbe made, but none certain or convincing.
It might bea reference to’s parents, sojourning for safety in Moab;
1 Sam.
xxii.
3;
or to Elimelechandhis family, taking refuge there from famine:
Ruth i.
I:
or generally, in reference to theseand other possible episodes( cf.
xvi.
3, 4), meaning‘you shall be reduced to seek food at’s’ But thereis nothing to show whatthe translator, or the ﬁrst writer, of these words intended.
Secondly, is the Greek text right? The error, if therebe one, is clearly shown to be old, by theO.
L.
and the agreement of the MSS.
, except as regards φάγεσθε.
Yet this evidence does not exclude early corruption:
and σὺν Μωὰβ is unintelligible, especially asa duplicate of συνκρουσθήσονται.
Can some such adjective as συμβωμὰ have been corrupted?‘ ye shall eat’might not be too remote foraparaphrase or guess, and as βωμὸς is not the usual Lxx.
word for‘ altar,’ the unusual word would be prone to disappear.

“ Ut bibereinsomnis sitiens cum quaeritetumor Non datur, ardorem qui membris stinguere possit, Sed laticum simulacra petit, ” μάταιον τὸ ἐνύπνιον] Heb.

seem to have misread, rather than paraphrased, perhaps‘for ABBREV vanity, and mp‘ hope,’‘ wait’:
i.
e.
nmp ABBREV for nppiw.
( mpw is hardly near enough to the meaning.
) 9.
Shortened and paraphrased in Lxx.
Heb.
begins the verse with two pairs of verbs, the firstof eacha reflexive form, and either fromthe same root, or one connected with the second verb, or else used with a play on words and different meaning:
the former alternative seems the more likely:
‘ Astonish yourselves, and be astonished:
blind yourselves, and be’( otherwise( most probably)‘ Tarry, and be astonished:
take your pleasure, and be blind!'), Vulg.
has’ te, εἰ’ ramz’m’, ﬂuctuate, et uacillate.
It seems that Lxx.
have attempted to translate the first pair only:
the second being supplied, with variants, by the Luc.
MSS.
from the Hexapla( Symmachus).
Their rendering, ἐκλύθητε καὶ Exams, resembles the treatment ofa similarly obscure pair of verbs in Zeph.
ii.
1, συνάχθητε καὶ συνδέθητε, Vulg.
conuenite, congregamini which looksas though Jerome, and perhaps Lxx.
also, regarded the verbs here as cognate pairs.
Scholz marks et uacillate;
inebriamini, as an addition to the Heb.
( Zusatz zum hebr.
Texte);
but whether this means an omission on the part of mm.
or not, it hardly seems to represent the facts of the case.

So the Wurzb.

Justin Martyr( Tryph.

2) Irenaeus( IV.

4)and Clement of Alexandria( Paed.
1.
76) are atanyrate not against it.
In fact,the shorter text, as’ven by RAQ, may be regarded as pretty certainly right for the Lxx.
;
though, as Mr Burkitt again points out, some confusion appears at ﬁrst sight in estimating the evidence of the Fathers, because it is sometimes doubtful whether they are not quoting from the Gospels:
where, in Matthew, most MSS.
, headed by CΔΦ have the longer text, though RBDL 33 have the shorter, which the principal editors( and RV.
) approve:
in Mark the evidence is all for the shorter form, and indeed for the further omission of ἐγγίζει μοι, which Dr Hatch supported:
these words, however, though they might be omitted in quotations( as bySt Cyprian), under the inﬂuence of the Gospels, must certainly stand in Isaiah.

Here the Heb.
is obscure:
but there is general agreement among modems, that Rahab is a nameappliedto Egypt, meaning ‘ arrogance’ or the like;

But Rallab seems also to have stood for a sea- monster,Job ix.
I3, xxvi.
12 τὸ κῆτος);
and it appears thus in parallelism to stand for the sea itself.
As the monster, perhaps, cf.
xxvii.
I, it stands for Egypt:
the great unwieldy river power, Ezek.
xxix.
3.
This however brings us no nearer to the Lxx.
rendering:
ματαιότητας appears to render mam‘the proud'in Ps.
xl.
4:
παράκλησις may be a guess( see above,on xxi.
2, c.
) or onmayhave been readas ABBREV:
αὕτη is out of its order, but ina sentence like this the Greek might have been arranged:
while‘ sitting still’ would seem to have been transferred to the next verse, καθίσας,and‘ go,'’ which seemedto contradictit, disappeared,or was rendered as merely hortatory by οὖν.
The Syriac( Peshitta)has here‘ uain is this your confidence'( see editorial notein journal of Theol.’
cs, January 1903, p.
270):
which certainly comes very near to the Lxx.
, however arrived at.
8.
καὶ εἰς βίβλων] Lxx.
, as frequently, omits the second( parallel) verb.
καιρῶν]‘ Occasions,’ which in this caseare future.
Καιρὸς is not usually put for‘ the day of the Lord,' or‘In that day,’ though see xviii.

and in viii.

The Hebrew here has not this meaning, but merely‘an after day, used generally.
B with Luc.
MSS.
reads καιρῷ, placing it after ταῦτα, but this hardly improves matters;
it may be a misunderstanding of ABBREV but in that case‘ after’ would be left untranslated.
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα] MSS.
generally perfix ἕως, butA omits it.
Heb.
ABBREV occurs twice:
it may mean, according to the pointing,‘ until,’ as inthe second place:
or‘ perpetuity,’ ABBREV then ῾for᾿:
or,‘ a’ which some authorities prefer:
so R.

LXX.
seem to haverepresented the ﬁrst, omitting ABBREV as ἕως, whichA omits, and the second in combination with ABBREV by εἷς αἰῶνα;
but their accuracy is scarcely to be trusted, as these Heb.
words occur in very varied combinations.
As some Luc.
MSS.
insert εἷς μαρτύριον, the ordinary Lxx.
text may be omitting’ ly’) altogether.
10.
Μὴ ἀναγγέλλετε] Heb.
has‘ see,’ cognate with‘ seers.’
LXX.
may have read ABBREV for man.
The rest of the verse seems confused:
τὰ ὁράματα ὁρῶσιν seems to take up the two cognate words‘ have’and λαλεῖτε is inserted( or substitutedfor‘ have’in the second place) to suit the supposed sense.
The best MSS.
omit‘ right’and᾿ smooth᾿;
Luc.
MSS.
have ὀρθῶς,andother insertions λαλιάν, δόλια,c.
).
ἑτέραν πλάνησιν] The orderofwords seems to forbid supposing that ἑτέραν represents ABBREV‘ right’ read asmm:
‘ strange,’‘ alien.’
πλάνησιν is one of LXX.
's favourite ideas, and the verb is used freely to express their interpretation of ver.
20, 21;
here it is near the meaning, but ῾visions᾿is omitted.
11.
ἀποστρέψατε.
.
.
ἀφέλετε.
.
.
ἀφέλετε] Heb.
has two former verbs intransitive:
the third is trans.
, but not the same as the second:
it is in fact the causal of the verb to which‘ sitting’in ver.
7 belongs.
τὸ λόγιον] If thisis notacorruption of τὸν ἅγιον( which Grabe printed,see below), it mustbean interpretation,in the sense of the‘ oracle’ or place where answers were given to inquiries made of the Lord.

In this case, the drift, according to LXX.
, differs from Heb.
‘ This’‘ this path,:

τὸν ἅγιον seems to have no MS.
authority, unless the Slavonic versionbe counted:
but the Lucianic cursives generally read τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰσραήλ.
12.
ψεύδει] Not the same Heb.
word as in ver.
9, or xxviii.
15 but ‘ oppression’( Ps.
lxii.
10), or‘ fraud.’
Some wish to transpose two letters of Heb.
, and read‘ perverseness’:
but LXX.
though quoted in supportof this, is not perceptibly nearer toitin meaning.
The sense of the Heb.
text, moreover,is supported by lix.
13.
ἐγόγγυσας] Reading some part of ΑΒΒREV( Niph.

has merely ῾thereon.

Lxx.
paraphrases to some extent, and introducesan unwarranted idea in ἑαλωκυίας:
τεῖχος corresponds in placeto‘ breach,’ perhaps because the translators hesitated at the half- abstract idea:
πόλεως·
corresponds to ῾wall,’ ὀχυρᾶς perhaps to‘ high’(A is aloneinomitting it):
the second of two words meaning‘ suddenly’is not rendered, or παραχρῆμαis considereda fair equivalent for both.
14.
καὶ τὸ πτῶμα] Lxx.
takes ‘ and he shall’ to bethenoun again, as at the endof ver.
13, and on the repetition of it changes to the more exact σύντριμμα;
the following words are loosely rendered, and ἐκ κεραμίου λεπτὸν( unless a duplicatehas taken the place of the right words) looks likea guess, λεπτὸν( AO alone:
other generally λεπτὰ) perhaps witha vague notion of ΑΒΒREV‘ vanity’for ABBREV.

ἀποσυρεῖς] This, the reading of 109 144 308( and 104 106 198 309 ἀποσύρεις) is surely right.

ματαία is most likely ΑΒΒREV ‘ shall’ read as ABBREV ‘ in’:

seems to be ‘ mixture’:
the quality of which would doubtless vary accordingto circumstances.
ἀναπιποιημένα] More generalthan Heb.
ABBREV ‘ salted,’ perhaps with salt- flavoured herbs.
ἐν κριθῇ] Scholz explains this as due toa mistake of sound, ABBREV for rm,‘ winnowed.’
It seems that raw must have been read by LXX.
, but this may have been in place of the omitted relative’R;
anyhow they seem to haveread‘ winnowed,’ either rightly, or from the kindred word for ‘ fan’ below,and omitted somethingin their rendering;
perhaps ABBREV passing from ABBREV to ABBREV.

In either case the meaning of ἐν is somewhat strained.

ἰάσεται] Two different Heb.

πλανήσει] Heb.
has a kindred verb and noun:
verb means to‘ sprinkle,’‘ shake’ or‘ wave’ to and fro:
kindred noun occurs in ver.
32, and xix.
16:
πλάνησις is in itself a poor rendering, and as it translates ‘ leadeth’ better, there is probably some confusion.
Lxx.
is a little loose in its treatment of such words:
xxii.
5, xxxvii.
3, & c.
καὶ διώξεται] Probably ABBREV( cf.
xiii.
14 ﬁn.
), or some partof ABBREV‘ ﬂee,’ and( causal)‘ pursue,’ read for῾a bridle.
κατὰ πρόσωπον] Fairly near to Heb.
‘ in the’( cheek- bones)‘ peoples,’ parallelto‘ nations,’ is rendered only by a pronoun:
λήμψεται is againa verb suppliedto help the sense and construction:
on πλάνησις, see above:
μάταια( in RCA)probablya careless addition from the previous clause.
29.
εὐφραίνεσθαι] Ofmusic, frequently, cf.

text seems to have been corrupted, and the repetition of διὰ παντὸς.
εἰσπορεύεσθαι.
.
.
εἰσελθεῖν( but see below), ὡσεὶ ἑορτάζοντας καὶ ὡσεὶ εὐφραινομένους, suggests that some duplicate renderings have been embodied.
The order seems to be somewhat confused, the usual practice of LXX.
being to keep it strictly.
μὴ is the articlebefore‘ song,’ taken as the interrog.
particle:
δεῖ ὑμᾶς would seem to be for‘ shall be to you’;
unless δι’ ὑμεῖς, as was the original reading, representing 033 or ΑΒΒREV read for ABBREV in which case the Greek corruption must be considerable.
διὰ παντὸς is 515;
,‘ like the’ taken as‘ 59,‘ wholly’:
εἰσελθεῖν is ABBREVandthe preceding εἰσπορεύεσθαι perhaps‘ heart,’ 335, also read as ABBREV ἑορτάζοντας may be an,a feast, or’w‘( festival)’ Or ifitrepresents ABBREV εὐφραινομένους may represent‘ joy of’ εἰσελθεῖν ΑΒΒREV for ABBREV ‘ as one that’ with‘) omitted as otiose.

have endeavoured to bring into connection.

This and the following verse are obscure in the Heb.
, and it is not surprisingto ﬁnd nut.

Perhaps Lxx.

λπὶς] Perhaps no:

The syntax is altered, ὅθεν being an insertion.
βοηθείας is probably an attempt to render and explain ΑBBREV ‘ destiny’( lit.
‘ foundation’);
αὐτὸς possiblyℵ ABBREV for ABBREV and ἐπεποίθει for ABBREV which is causal.
The sense is altered in the Greek, which seems to suggest military music rather than thanksgiving.
ἐκ μεταβολῆς] This must be intended to represent‘ waving,’‘ agitation,’ see on ver.
28, ταράξω.
33.
ἀπατηθήσῃ] This, though found onlyin two cursives, 48 308 is clearly the right reading, ἀπαιτηθήσῃ( NABQ ἃς.
) being an easy corruption.
Jerome renders the Lxx.
here by decipieris.
The main proof, however,is that it evidently renders the Heb.
nnan, taking it as 2nd pers.
imperf.
from ABBREV =ἀπατάω( Job xxxi.
27):
whereas it really ‘ a Τopheth’ or‘ burning- place’( see commentariesforexplanation).
This‘ burning- place’is made readyforthe king of Asshur:
“ the Moloch- pile for the Μelech,” M.
Arnold, Isaiah ofp.
128.
The Heb.
of the verseis obscure,and the Greek scarcely intelligible.
πρὸ ἡμερῶν corresponds to ABBREV lit.
‘ from’i.
e.
beforehand.
The MSS.
vary in detail;
the verse begins inA with οὐ γὰρ σύ, inB with σὺ γάρ, altered to σοὶ γάρ :
in NQ with οὐ γάρ.
The 2nd pers.
pronouns are no doubt due to the misunderstanding of Tophtehas the verb.
μὴ καὶ σὺis altered inB to μὴ καὶ σοί, giving an easier sense.
The rest of the words showa general correspondence.
Topheth or Tophet was a name given toa place in the valley of Hinnom, where sacrifices were offered to Moloch( 2 Kings xxiii.
IO, Jer.
vii.
31, C.
).
There is possibly— see the quotation above M.
Arnold — a play on words between Moloch and Melech, Of course no king of Assyria met his end at this Tophet, so faras is known.
But, to those who do not seek to restrict the application of prophecy, it may not seem impossible that there may bea reference to the end of the last kingof Nineveh,ﬁring his palace over himself:
the story familiar from’s Sardcmapalus( =Assur- banipal), though later knowledge transfers the eventto another king, whose name, however, is uncertain.

In warm climates, the river sides are the favourite hauntsof all beasts, domestic as well as wild.
Scholz, thinking of the overflow of the Nile, takes the verse as evidence of the Egyptian knowledge of the translator.

LXX.
have reduced this verse to something apparently widely different from Heb.
Yet, if the ﬁrst ὑμᾶς were omitted, and a stop inserted after ἀθετῶν, supplying an indefinite subjectto ἀθετεῖ, it would bring the ﬁrst part of the verse very near to the meaning of the original.
There is no ground for supposing this to be the genuine Lxx.
reading or intention;
it merely shows how small the verbal departure is.
ὑμᾶς, ὑμᾶς]nnx‘ thou’read as name, ABBREV iated perhaps, may account for one;
the other must be an additionby Lxx.

has same verb again,‘ thou shalt be’:
Lxx.
fall back on a stop- gap word,see on xxiii.
7, c.
;
and ἡττηθήσονται at the end ofthe verse seems to be intrOduced in much the same way to balance it.
ὥς σὴς ἐπὶ ἱματίου] ἐπὶ ἱματίου is evidently ABBREV‘ to deal( in dealing)’ read as the noun ABBREV‘ cloak,’‘ garment,’ with prep.
5 taken or read as ABBREV or ABBREV Once off the track, Lxx.
guessed or misread also the previous word 111513,‘ when thou hast’( or,‘ ﬁnished’:
the form is unusual,and some read 111533, giving this sense more decidedly).
What they made ofitis hard to say:
ABBREV would mean‘ like an’ but the Bibledoes not mention ants in connection with destructiveness.
Ver.

xlviii.
14.
τῶν ἀπειθοῦντων] Scholz thinks ABBREV‘ in the morning’ was asD' ABBREV:
but looking to ver.
1, and other passages, we should expect ἀθετούντων in that case.
If ABBREV weretakenas participle,the meaning is nearly the oppositeof the Greek:

to the extent of a negative:

phrase, LXX.
have merely φωνή:
and in 1 Kings xviii.
41 LXX.
have for itthe fine phrase, howere come by, φωνὴν τῶν πδοῶν( τοῦ ὑετοῦ).

Heb.

Can LXX.
have been thinking of different sizes of locusts, and the adjectives perhaps come froma marginal explanations? But MrH.

ἐμπαίζονται] The word ABBREV many here have been thus rendered, or again miseread.
Scholz suggests ABBREV as their reading, by his favorite explanations of a sound- error.
( παίζοντα, Gen.
xxi.
9, is used for this word, and apparently duplicatedas ABBREV’, Isaac.
) Such a discrepancy, however, if possibleinthe first instance, would be most likely detected bya corrector of MSS.
On the whole, if LXX.
did not read ABBREV( and this is regularly rendered by συρίζω),t seems more probable that they tried to render the present Heb.

B has δικαιοσύνῃ.
The former agrees with Heb.

the obscure word pinv suggests itself( xxiii.

At theendof the verse, it corresponds more directly to ABBREV‘ treasure.’
The syntaxis changed.

Again, ἀξιοῦντες εἰρήνην, read after ἀποσταλήσονται by RAand many cursives, including the Lucianic, is duplicated by παρακαλοῦντες εἰρήνην, read by the uncials and some( but not the Luc.
) cursives at the end of the verse.
87 97 228 have λαλοῦντες for ἀξιοῦντες.
NA and somecursives also read γὰρ after ἄγγελοι, and BQarenearly alone in reading οὗτοιfor αὐτοί.
Removing these duplicates, which may have come, partly at least, from other versions, we are left with Ἰδοὺ δὴ οὓς ἐφοβεῖσθε, βοήσονται ἀφ’ ὑμῶν·
ἄγγελοι ἀποσταλήσονται ἀξιοῦντες εἰρήνην πικρῶς κλαίοντες.
This we must analyse, phrase by phrase.
οὓς ἐφοβεῖσθε] This seems tobeABBREV‘ your’for ABBREVadoubtful phrase,generally rendered, with change of vowel- points,‘ their valiant ones. ’
φοβηθήσονται] This is readbyℵ cb AQ*andabout twenty cursives, but not by Syro- hex.’
s βοήσονται seems preferable, as(a)the con- struction is harder with this verb,(b) it agreesin meaning with Heb.
,( c) φοβηθ.
may be due to confusion with the previous( duplicate) words.
In the’orum Apocryplza,in a note on Judith xvi.
11 Mr Ball points out a similar confusion between these verbs:
to which wemay adda very similar case in xxiv.
14 above.
ἀποσταλήσονται] This word, and ἀξιοῦντες,are additions of the LXX.
, to complete the sense, as they havea participle forthe verb‘ shall weep,’ and preferreda more precise connecting link ‘ messengers’ and‘ peace.’
Ἀποσταλήσονται might indeed have been suggested ABBREV by the letters of ABBREV‘ peace’:
but in that case there would bea triplicate rendering of this word.
8.
τούτων and πρὸς τούτους are not in Heb.
;
cf.
οὗτοι in ver.

ὅ φόβος τὸν My] It is not veryclear how Lxx.
have dealt with this verse.
The easiest supposition seems to be, that, confusing the, two expressions, ms ABBREV wayfaring man’ and ABBREVDam‘ he the’theyomitted the ﬁrst, and putthe second in its place, reading ABBREV‘ peoples’ for ABBREV and perhaps taking 080, in the sense, of DOD, of fainting for fear.
Whether ABBREV was conversely read after‘ covenant,’ and won,‘ he hath’omitted, or the latter para- phrased as αἴρεται, it is hardly possible to say.
This verse and the following are certainly treated either with some freedom, or with some wantof grip.
9.
The Greek omits the second verb inthe ﬁrst clause, possibly inthe second also.
ἕλη is difficult;
by the orderitwould correspond to Sop,‘ withereth,’ but no clue toany connection appears, unless LXX.
read was, see on xxxv.
7:
there is also ABBREV‘ like a desert.’
to forABBREV‘ willows,’ might perhaps have suggested the Greek.
φανερὰ ἔσται] This phrase suggests that ABBREV ‘ shakes off’ taken as a passive of mu,‘ make bare’( however,in xxxii.
15 it in a different sense,‘ be poured out’).
Originally, therefore, translation would mean‘ shall be laid’;
but probably it was thought laterto mean‘ glorious’( see on Γαλιλάια, above).
Γαλιλαία] Lxx.
substitute this name for the neighbouring‘ Bashan,’’ perhaps todoit honour,in the lightof ix.
I, especially if φανερὰ was misunderstood.
11.
νῦν] Repeated from ver.
10;
not in Heb.
ὄψεσθε] It is hardly likely that Lxx.
would render ABBREV‘ ye shall’ thus, as being metaphorical:
they may have read it as nun( or ABBREV?).
αίσχυνθήσεσθε] Soℵ ca AV 62 87 93 97 106 147 228 :

26) quotes the, passage with both verbs:
mmc videbitis, nunc’ ntellz’ getz’s, mmc’m’.
This gives three verbs answering to the three in ver.
10:
but it is most unlikely that all Greek MSS.
would, if this werethe true text, have agreedin leaving out one verbofthe two.
Cyprian may have quoted froma copy whose original hada correction inits text.
On the whole,’s reading seems best:
ABBREV ‘ hay,’‘ dry grass, may have been read as some part of ‘ 13 ABBREV ‘ be ashamed’ ABBREV cf.
the discrepancy in xxviii.
16.
ματαία ἔσται ἢ ἰσχὺς] Heb.
apparently‘ ye shall bring forth stubble.’
Lxx.
do not seemtobe paraphrasing this, but tobe reduced to guesswork.
ματαία might indeed be due to w‘ stubble’:
but it is, strictly speaking, out of the order, and no plausible suggestion ofa misreading occurs.
τοῦ πνεύματος] This connection of πνεύματος·
with what precedes is against Heb.
accents, and againstthe generally approved renderingof Heb.
12.
ἐν ἀγρῷ] Scholz gives thisas mia‘ ﬁeld’ for Ἰὼ‘ lime.’
It is again, however,out ofthe strict order.
If ABBREV had been read as ABBREV’s special word for‘ thorns,’ we should have ἄκανθα accountedforin its place,and the converse of the misreading, as it appears, in xxvii.
3.
The word in Heb.
which means‘ thorns’ here, curiously enough, hasa close resemblance to one meaning‘ ends’ from root ABBREV cut off.’
LXX.

τοὺς συστρεφομένους]ℵ ΑΟΓ 26 41 49 51 91 104 106 198 228 239 306 309 read thus:
Luc.
MSS.
have ἀναστρεφομένους, Β τρεφομένους, which alone appears to give any sense in connection with the Heb.
, the word‘ towers’ being literally‘a thing raisedup,’ and the verb applied to‘ rearing up’:
so in i.
2 Lxx.
have ἐγέννησα, Aq.
Theod.
ἐξέθρεψα for it.
Consequently it seems that συντρεφομένους is the original ofA's reading, though even then the preposition is hard to account for.
This, on awrong idea oftheintended meaning,was corrupted to συστρεφ.
, and later improved into ἀναστρεφ.
But possibly cyc was wrongly written after τογc.
86 has συντρεφ.
, 144 ανατρεφομενους.
On this verse, in the Hebrew, the commentators quote Virg.

This verse seems to have been amplified, with some from the meaning.
μικρὸν καίω.
.
.
ᾦ οὗ( συνεβουλεύσαν).
.
.
τῷ seem to be additions, and also the copula in οὐδέ:
while λαὸς is repeated ina different place.
μικρὸν καὶ μέγαν]See on ver.
4.
μέγαν might be due to taking ABBREV from ABBREV ABBREV in the senseof‘ strength’:
but more likely from duplicating ABBREV from ABBREV the rest of the phrase being prefixed without warrant.
In this latter case συνεβουλεύσαν is ABBREV read as ABBREV the negative introduced to couple it with ᾔδει= ABBREV the ABBREV misread.
After ᾔδει there should probably bea colon,and the sentence is twice taken up, with βαθύφωνον=‘ deepof language,’ in accus.
, and with λαὸς πεφαυλισμένοςin the nominative, cams pendens.
συνεβουλευσαν is the reading ofA 41 86 106 198 :
ℵQΓ συνεβουλεύσαντο, Β συνεβουλεύσατο.
πεφαυλισμένος] Heb.
‘ stammering’isactuallythe passive ofaverb meaning‘ deride.’

Cf.
liv.
2, and see below, on ver.
23.
21.
τὸ ὄνομα] Taking ABBREV‘ there’ as ABBREV‘ name.’
The sense consequently differs.
τόπος] Some have explained the Heb.
‘ place’ as=‘ in place of.
Delitzsch refers toI Kings xxi.
19 as proving,“ if Hoseai.
10 does not,” that itmayhave that meaning;
but disapproves it Κυρίου.
.
.
ἐστίν.
.
.
ὑμῖν ἔσται] ForA's ἐστίν, the MSS.
generally have ὑμῖν.
Probably duplicate renderings of mm ABBREV Κυρίου being out of its order the ﬁrst time, and the word read as ABBREV the second time, with change of pronoun.
πλατεῖς καὶ εὐρύχωροι] Heb.
‘ wide stretching,’‘ broad of lit.
‘ of hands, The latterpartof the verseis somewhat differentinGr.
and Heb.
At ﬁrst sight,‘ gallant’ appears tobe omitted.
But‘ gallant’is the same Heb.
word as‘ in majesty’ earlier in the verse, and μέγας stands for it in both places.
ABBREV ‘ ship, ’ appears to have been read as ABBREV( γάρ)and ὁ θεὸς inserted.
By the orderof words, it is probable that οὐδὲ πορεύσεται is added by LXX.
, and that οὗ παρελεύσεταί με represents the‘ shall pass’ of 22.
ἄρχον] Somewhat vague for‘ law- giver,’ which Scholz however seems to be wrong in classing as omitted by LXX.
, or rather, among his“ Zusätze zum hebr.
Texte.
” After all, the Athens were ἄρχοντες.
23.
Generally taken as a simile ofa ship,as in Horace, Od.
1.

But Kay, following Clericus, argues with much probability that it isareturn to the imageofthe tent, with its‘ cords,’ same Heb.
word as in ver.
20, its ‘ pole, ’ and‘ banner.’
This last word is not, indeed, properly used in the sense of‘ sail. ’
σχοινία suits either interpretation, as does ἱστός,‘ mast’ or‘ tentpole’;
while οὐ χαλάσει τὰ ἱστία and οὐκ ἀρεῖ σημεῖονare duplicates, one suiting the ship, the otherthe tent:
raising and unfurling a.
standard being closely connected.
As it stands, Lxx.
must necessarily be taken of the ship:
but traces of another rendering, possibly ofthe other interpretation, survive.
οὖ.
.
.
τοίνυν] ABBREV‘ prey,’ was probably taken as conj.
‘ until,’ and accidentally or otherwise put at the headof the clauseinplace ofm,‘ then,’ which was transposed to the next clause as τοίνυν.
πολλοὶ] Epithet transferred from ‘ plunder’ to ‘ lame’ :
in Heb.
it isa noun,‘ abundance.
24.
‘ The inhabitant’ is omittedby lxx.
, and the sentence adjusted toa single subject.

The Lxx.
paraphrase is not very remote:
but it is doubtful how much of the Hebrew it is intendedto render.
If the whole, then the last clause in the Greek verse, καὶ ὀνοκένταυροι.

, perhaps from xiii.
22.
If however σπαρτίον ἐρήμου corresponds to the‘ lineof desolation,’ γεωμετρίας mightbe an additionof Lxx.
to explain the phrase, and καὶ ὀνοκένταυροι ἐν αὐτῇ, withaverb supplied,a misreading;
perhaps ABBREV ABBREV for ABBREV.
12.

The correspondence between Heb.

This was the name ofa female demonof Chaldaic mythology,who deceived Adam, according to Rabbinic legends, and who murdered children.
Perhaps here‘ the screech- owl,’ as KayandW.

The objectionsto supposing that Isaiah couples together wild beasts and demons are, however, serious.

ABBREV verse is treated more freely than usual, and attempts to decide what not.

The similar passage, Iix.

We might conjecture κρίσιν καὶ ἀνταπόδοσιν ἀνταποδώσει.

Scholz suggests that the Greek word was suggested by its resemblance to Heb.
ABBREV Lxx.
however must have known that the ABBREV is only the pronominal prefix.
and the Heb.
word is a very common one.
Prof.
Margoliouth, supposing the Greek“ Wisdom of Solomon”to have preceded Greek Isaiah, says( Line :
of Defence ofthe Bibl.
Revelation, p.
17)“ It would seem that the jingleof the Hebrew wordin Isaiah with the Greek word used in Wisdom was what suggested this inaccurate but elegant rendering.
” There certainly seems to be some affinity the Greek of Wisdom and Isaiah:
see on iii.
10, and xliv.
20:
but the difficulties seem rather increased than diminishedtby supposing Wisdom to be the earlier.
On the whole, Scholz's view, which in itself Prof.
Margoliouth supports, seems to go as far as is necessary in accounting for this peculiar word here.
7.
ἦ ἄνυδρος] Heb.

but it seems more proper to take it of the‘ burning’which causes themirage, which, even if it could be said to‘ becomea pool,’ could as in xlix.

‘ smite’ them.
The immediate effect of the mirage, moreover, appears to be refreshingratherthan oppressive, until the delusion is perceived.
The Heb.
word means properly“ glowing, dazzling dryness”.
εὐφροσύνη] Heb.
here‘ habitation,’ not as xxxii.
14.
Perhaps a confusion ofm:
with nu,‘ rest,’ to which, at leastinthe special form used Gen.

Chapters xxxvi.

Historical passages somewhat similar in tone, and intheir hearing on the prophecies, occur in chap.

, xxviii.
, xxxii.

foll.
, and Haggai.
The ﬁrst of these is the most likethe present passage, the other prophets’ books being throughout more broken.
These chapters stand between the two main portions of the book, setting the seal of history,so to speak, upon Isaiah's Assyrian prophecies.
It is hardly needful to repeat that many modern critics deny Isaiah's authorship of chh.
xl.
— lxvi.
On the whole it will found( whether there be any necessary connection between views held on these two questions, or no) that these deny also his authorship of xxxvi.
— xxxix.
, and hold that the parallel passages in2 Kings, 17— xx.
19, are therefoundin their original place and form;
while supporters ofthe traditional view, that Isaiahisthe author, substantially, of allthe sixty- six chapters of the book bearing his name, make no exception here, and consider that the compilerof Kings borrowed from Isaiah.
Thus Kay says,“ These two chapters( viz.
, xxxvi.
, xxxvii.
).
.
.
are the historical goal of chh.
vii.
— xxxv.
The two following on the other hand, are the historical starting- point of chh.
xl.
— lxvi.’
And previously:
“ These chapters are referred to in 2 Chro.
xxxii.
32 as a part of the VISION of Isaiah.
Nearly the whole of them is embodied in 2K.
xviii— xx,’ Delitzsch, allowing that the textin Kings“ is in many places the betterand more authentic,” warns us not to drawahasty from this,as“ in the relationof Jer.
Iii.
to2 Kings xxiv.
18 — xxv.
have a proof that the text of a piece may be preserved more faithfully in the secondary place than in the original.
” He gives several for thinking the passage original in Isaiah:
i) That the authorof Kings had Isaiah's book before him, as shown by comparing2 Kings xvi.
5 with Isai.
vii.
1.
( ii)The reference in2 Chron.
, as above.
( iii) That the Chronicler knows Isaiah asa historian of Uzziah's reign(2 Chron.
xxvi.
22).
( iv) That the style ispropheticin character, and worthy of Isaiah.
(v) That Isaiah elsewhereincorporateshistorical memoranda, speaking sometimesin the ﬁrst, sometimes in the third person.
( vi)Chap.
vii.
3 and xxxvi.
2 betray the same author.
( vii)The order ofthe narrative, which is not chronological, is copiedin Kings.
Vitringa thought Isaiah the author.
Prof.
Skinner( Isaiah, in Camb.
Bible for Schools) says,“ there is no reasonable doubt that these chapters are an excerpt from the canonical books of Kings.
.
.
the narrative before us reveals its secondary character bya tendency towards abridgement and simplification and in other respects shews‘ manifest tracesof having passed through the hands of the compiler of Kings.
”’ These words he quotes Prof.
Driver, who pointsout that“2 Kings xviii.
14 — 16 are not Isaiah, and are derived froma different source from that which has been followed by the compiler in the ensuing prophetical narrative.’
He holds thatI sai.
xxxvi.
— xxxix.
“ are probablyin their more place in the Book of Kings, whence they were excerpted( with afewslightabridgmentsand alterations, and with one addition, viz.
the Song of Hezekiah)”.
.
.
“ The superior originality of2 Kings xx.
4 to Isa.
xxxviii.
4, 7 —8 is speciallyBp Lowth says,“ We ﬁnd the same narrative in the Second Book of Kings,.
.
.
and these chapters of Isaiah,.
.
.
for much the most part( the account of thesicknessof Hezekiah only excepted), are buta different copyof that narration.
” At thebeginning of ch.
xxxix.
says,“ Hitherto the copy of this history in the Second Book of Kings has been the most correct:
in this chapter, that in Isaiahhas the advantage.’
Prof.
W.
E.
Barnes says of xxxvi.
, xxxvii.
,“ These chapters correspond( save forafew omissions) with 2 Kings xviii.
13 — xix.
both passages are probably drawn from the same source, viz.
a book oftheAnnals of Judah.
”( And similarlyofxxxviii.
1—8, 21, 22.
) On the whole, no hypothesisis free from difficulties.
Probably it isa mistake to try to decide the question in the light of general theories as to the composition of the Bookof Isaiah.
The view that the original source of these chapters is to be sought in Isaiah seems rather the simpler.
On turning tothe Septuagint, the verbal differences between Kings and Isaiah will be found considerable;
exceeding the differences in the Hebrew, as though independently translated;
following, however,asa rule, differences of the Heb.
text;
and the version in Kings generally closer than that in Isaiah.
Hence, in some cases, when the Heb.
is identical inKingsand Isaiah,it may happen that the mm.
of Kings is closer than the Lxx.
of Isaiah tothe Hebrew of Isaiah.
See, for instance, 2 Kings xviii.
34 = Isai.
xxxvi.
19.
2 Kings xx.
7 = Isai.
xxxviii.
21.
( Delitzsch carefully notes the differences between the Heb.
texts of Kings and Isaiah throughout.
) The Hexaplaric additions to the Greek text in Isaiah, several of which arefound inB, are nearly always identical with the Greek wording in Kings, or very close to it.
On the other hand in Kingsa few resemblances to the wording in Isaiah are found inΑ, the influence of Aquila being perceptible.
Thus the Lxx.
of Kings inA, and of Isaiah inB, come nearestto one another among the principal uncials:
being in each case,it would seem, less pure than their rivals.
Conversely,’s Kings and’s Isaiah show wider divergence.
The chronology of these chapters is of well- known difficulty, but cannotbe discussed here.
No explanation hasso far disposedofall awkwardness.
The Greek, in thenarrative portions, presents comparatively little difficulty.

The latter— the identitycan hardly be doubted— appears here ina subordinate butnot as entirely disgraced.

4.
Τί πεποιθὼς εἰ] Lxx.
of Kings agrees with Heb.
of both places, rendering Τίς ἦ πεποίθησις αὕτη ἣν πέποιθας.
5.
LXX.
of Kings again agrees nearly with Heb.
, which has in Kings‘ thou sayest,’ in Isaiah‘1 say’( difference onlyoft in consonantal text).
Literally Heb.
here reads:
‘ 1 say — only a word of — counsel and strength for war.’
If Lxx.
took the verb interrogatively, the Greek might almost be considered to be accounted for, and it has been proposed( by Wellhausen and Seinecke)to render in Kings,‘ Thinkest thou thatamere word of the lips is counsel and strength for war?’ which comes, after all, somewhat nearto nor.

the Hexaplaric insertion is almost in agreement with Lxx.

omitted, ὅς after ἐστίν, ἀφεῖλεν for ἀπέστησεν, κατὰ πρόσωπον for ἐνώπιον, and ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ omitted at the end.
There are, however, many minor variants among the MSS.
containing the words.
The ﬁnal omission of ἐν Ἰερ.

ℵ *B read τῶν τοπαρχῶν;

, τοπ.
ἑνὸς τῶν δουλῶν τοῦ Κυρίου μου τῶν μικρῶν.
Kings has ἐλαχίστων, so that the Hexaplaric Isaiah again differsa little from it.
At this point beginsa fresh sentence, which seems due to misunderstanding the Oriental turn of expression;
the stress on οἰκέται seems hardly ordinary.
τοπάρχου] The Heb.
word is said to beborrowed from Assyrian, meaning a governor ofa province.

11.
Συριστὶ] Aramaic,the usual language, in its Western form, of diplomatic intercourse at this time.
The educated Jews knew it, but not Assyrian;
the common people apparently understood none but their own tongue.
The Rabshakeh seems to have been an accomplished linguist and orator.
12.
The prepositions are varied in the different texts.
Heb.

of Kings have ἐπὶ(B) πρὸς(Α).
.
.
πρὸς.
.
.
ἐπί.

of Isaiah πρὸς in each place.
It seems therefore hardly possible to decide certainly as to the meaning of each separate preposition;
there seems to be a touch of oppositionto the last,‘ against’the men thatsiton the wall, while‘thy master and thou’are treated contemptuously, as of least importance.
With the men on the wall theremaybe dealings:
on the kingand his counsellorthe haughty envoy will scarcely cast a glance.
13.
Ἰουδαιστὶ] The Rabshakeh spoke at ﬁrst in Hebrew:
when remonstrated with, he answered witha momentary compliance in Aramaic, in which he had been addressed;
and then raised his voice again, and spokein Hebrew, fully aware of the advantage it gave him.
τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ μεγάλου] Here, and above, ver.
4, this phrase is an extra title, and βασιλεὺς·
Ἀσσυρίων the ordinary designation.
( Cf.
βασιλεὺς of the king of Persiain Greek writers, e.
g.
Thucyd.
1.
128 137,c.
) This is in agreement with Heb.
, and the words are therefore best so divided in Greek.
In this phrase LXX.
of Kings is shortened, and less exact:
otherwise, the LXX.
in each book follows its own Heb.
with fair exactness in ver.
13, 14.
15.

Kings.

The Heb.
of Kings is fuller than thatof Isaiahin this verse;
adding after ‘ vineyards,’ ‘a land of oil, olive and honey, that yemaylive, and not die’:
continuing‘ and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he enticeth,’ in place of‘ Lest Hezekiah entice you.
LXX.
of Kings and Isaiah follow each their own Heb.
in the main:
each has γῆ in nomin.
by a species of attraction, perhaps, rather than casus pendent.
Lxx.
of Kings maybe right in rendering ABBREV by ὅτι rather than as‘ when.

‘ the ideaoftheir delivering.

Cf.
such constructions as incepto desistere victam!” The same, without the‘ and,’ in ver.

Lxx.
of Kings, on the other hand, has in the ﬁrst sentence καὶ ὅτι, according toB,A reading μή.
This seems to point toBin Kings having preservedan old text, andAin Kings having modified or perhaps assimilated its Greek.
But the resemblance, on this minute point, betweenBin Kings and Heb.
in Isaiah is noteworthy.

τῶν ἐθνῶν.

τὴν γῆν] Lxx.
of Kings has τῶν γαιῶν.

Heb.
Kings alone, has ‘ they, the people, held their peace.
διὰ τὸ προστάξαι.

Lxx.
Kings, with both Heb.
, has Orat.
Recta, and the common anacoluthon, ἐντολὴ.
.
.
λέγων 22.
mm.
Kings has verbal differences:
after ὁ γραμματεὺς it has not τῆς δυνάμεως, nor has either Heb.
:
ὁ ἀναμιμνήσκων for ὁ ὐπομνηματογράφος, and διερρηχότες τὰ ἱμάτια for ἐσχισμένοι τοὺς χιτῶνας.
τῆς δυνάμεως] Not in Heb.
;
it seems difficultto give itany other meaning than‘ the power’ or‘the force,’ i.
e.
implying thatthe military secretary, or perhaps rather the secretary to Hezekiah's commission.
XXXVII.
The variations in ver.
1 — 4 are not extensive, and Greek text mainly follows its own Heb.
:
as in theorderof the phrase‘ Isaiah,the son of Amoz, the prophet’:
where Heb.
of Kings goes against the usual rule with regard to this kind of phrase.
3.
ὀνειδισμοῦ] Lxx.
of Isaiah is more periphrastic here than Kings, and inserts this term, making four against three of Heb.
Scholz marks ὀργῆς as the extra word:
but the comparison with Kings is against this.
4.
Kings, Heb.
and Greek,‘ all the words ofR.
5 — 7.
Lxx.
Kings continues to show differences of παιδάρια, closer to Heb.
, for πρέσβεις, δίδωμι ἐν αὐτῷ for ἐμβαλῶ εἷς αὐτόν, καταβαλῶ αὐτὸν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ for πεσεῦται μαχαίρᾳ, besides some minor points.
The Hebraism μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπὸ τῶν λόγων occurs in both.
8, 9.
Here Heb.
( both) and um.
Kings are nearly in agreement, Kings(Heb.
and LXX.
) inserting‘ Behold’ before ‘ he is come, ’ Heb.
of Kings alone being without another verb(‘ turned’in‘ heard’ Heb.
lsai.
) before ‘ and( he) sent.
LXX.
of Isaiah however presents considerable divergence;
after‘ Libnah’it continues in ℵAOQ, supported in the main by 24 26 49 86 106 198 and partially by some others( but the Lucianic MSS.
are substantially in agreement with Heb.
and Lxx.
Kings):
Kai ἤκουσεν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν Θαράθα βασιλεὺς·
Αἰθίοπων πολιορκῆσαι αὐτόν·
καὶ ἀκούσας ἀπέστρεψεν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀπέστρεψενΑ)κ.
τ.
λ.
But B reads Kai ἤκουσεν ὅτι ἐπῆρεν ἀπὸ Λαχείς.
Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Θαράκακ.
τ·
.
λ.
These variations seem due to confusion of the two occurrences of ἤκουσεν, aided by the ﬁrst καὶ in place of ὅτι( Luc.
MSS.
ἤκουσε γὰρ.
.
.
) as Heb.
has ABBREV The text has in fact been shortened in two different ways.
InA's text βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων is pretty clearly an iryertion for clearness.
For if the subject of ἤκουσεν 1° had originallystoodin text, it would scarcely have dropped out, as the sentence is hardly clear without it:
especially as it appears in the very text which omits other words at that point.
It would, however,be clearly impossiblein the textasB has it.
Probably Lxx.
lsai.
originally read:
Καὶ ἤκουσεν ὅτι ἀπῆρεν ἀπὸ Λαχείς.
Καὶ ἤκουσεν βασ.
Ἀσσυρίων) ὅτι ἐξῆλθεΘ.
κ.
τ.
λ.
καὶ ἀκούσας ἀπέστρεψεν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν]Α by mistake repeats ἀπέστρεψεν instead of ἀπέστειλεν.
Heb.
lsai.
reads what corresponds to καὶ ἀκούσας ἀπέστειλε.
Delitzsch thinks that ‘ heard’ is a mistake for‘ turned’ ἐπέστρεψεν Kings), but it can hardly be proved.
Θαράθα]’s spelling Θαράκαis nearer.
Tirhakah is named only here.
Under him Ethiopia became the dominant power along the Nile, with influence extending over Egypt itself.
See on chap.
xviii.
10.
Οὕτως ἑρεῖτε] Β of Kings omits all before Μή σε ἀπατάτω, for whichit reads Μὴ(umpire :
σε.
A supplies the missing clause, but shows traces of’s version in τῷ λέγειν.
The direct challenge, Μή σε ἀπατάτω ὁ θεός σου, crowns Sennacherib's impiety.
11.
ὦς ἀπώλεσαν] LXX.
Kings, with τοῦ ἀναθεματίσαι αὐτούς, is more exact.
12.
Lxx.
Isai.
, according to what appears to bethebetter text, omits‘the children of Eden’( though the Luc.
Mss.
insert), and the names‘ Gozan,H.
and R.’
thus appear as the antecedents to the relative clause.
The following proper name, Θαιμὰδ Α, Θεεμὰθ Β, Θαιμὰν Q, may have been conjecturally altered:
but the Lxx.
spelling of unfamiliar proper names is so erratic, that noinference can, as a rule, be drawn from it.
The exact localities of‘ Eden’ and‘ Telassar’ are not certain:
as Prof.
Skinner points out, Til- Assuri( Hill of Asshur’) was likelyto occur frequently.
Eden is said to have beena small kingdom on the Upper Euphrates.
Θαιμὰδ] On TemaandTeman see above, on xxi.

ἤνοιξεν αὐτὸ ἐναντίον Κυρίου]“A prayer without words’( Delitzsch).
The preceding clauses in Heb.
, ‘ and read it, and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord,’ appear tobe due to the Hexapla( from Theod.
Symm.
) when they occur in Greek texts.

It cannot be denied that Lxx.
Isaiah shows some force and ﬁtness to the circumstances:
but it may be merelydue toa slight confusion, amid which καὶ ἄκουσον may have dropped out.
18.
ἐπ’ ἀληθείας] The phrase is classical:
Demosth.
de Cor.
294 εἷ γ’ ἐπ’ ἀληθείας δέοι σκοπεῖσθαι, seems, however,to differ somewhatin meaning.
Lxx.
Kings has ἀληθείᾳ:
Plato, Protag.
343 D, οὐκ ἀληθείᾳ ἀγαθόν.
This is more usual with the article:
but in both passages quoted there is an appearance of intentional variation of phrase.
τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅληκ.

Here we seem to havea genuine prophecyof Isaiah inserted in the historical account.

Burkitt, in Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, June 1902, on“ The so- called Quinta of 4 Kings,” points outthat the Quinta, in the Syro- hexaplar margin, supports the consonantal text of Wellhausen's emendation:

The interval between Sennacherib's ﬂight and his death is not known, but the statement that he‘ dwelt at Nineveh’suggests some lapseof time;
and his sons must have reached manhood at his death, which is placedby modern authorities, according tothe Assyrian monuments, about 681B.

Nineveh is mentioned by Isaiah only in this place.

Ἀσαρὰχ] Νασαρὰχ Β( Ἐσδρὰχ Β, ἘσθρὰχΑof Kings), Heb.
ABBREV No Assyrian god of the name is known from any other source.
πάτραρχον, with which compare Symmachus' πάτραρχα εἴδωλαin viii.
21 suggests that some deity of the King’s family or clan is meant.
Esarhaddon had been made king or viceroyof Babylon byhis father,and dissension had brolcen out in the royal family.
Adrammelech and Sharezer( only the former is named in secular history) were able to compass the murder, but nota successful revolt.
Tradition makes them ancestors of the Sassunian and Arzerunian clans in Armenia( 50 Delitzsch);
but the “ ten Byzantine Caesars,” headed Leo(the Armenian), cannot be safely assigned this ancestry.
The resemblance of names to those in Zech.

The corresponding chapter of Kings is differently arranged, and does not contain’s song of thanksgiving.
The Heb.
text of Kings is otherwise somewhat fuller.
The two Lxx.
versions differ frequently in choice of expressions, and each generally follows its own Heb.
See, however, 2 Kings xx.
7 LXX.
and lsai.
xxxviii.
21 Heb.
The event of this chapter seems to have preceded Sennacherib's attack,or at any rateits ﬁnal collapse:
see ver.
6.
The chronology we have seen to be a matter of great difficulty.
The‘ fifteen years’ added to Hezekiah's life, and the twenty- nine years assigned to his reign, bring his illness to the fourteenth year.
Modern authorities have put forward many schemes, generally in disagreement with some, at any rate, of the Biblical numbers, and with each other.
Their most general agreement is in assigning the date 701 to Sennacherib's invasion:
yet this, which satisfies Assyrian chronology, is too earlyfor Egyptian authorities, who would put it as late as 687—6.
Prof.
W.
Barnes, accepting this, ingeniously gets rid of a good many difficulties but is obliged to place Hezekiah 's accession six years after the fallof Samaria, insteadof before(2 Kings xviii.

Cheyne here quotes Jerome on Ezek.

;
“ Nec statim sequitur, ut,quia propheta praedicit, veniat quod praedixit.
Non enim praedixit ut veniat, sed ne’ That prophecyis often conditional, may be freely granted.
It is indeed necessary to its moral purpose that it shouldbe so.
Else the prophets would have been all as helplessas Cassandra, whenever they had woe or punishment to proclaim.
But not all prophecy is conditional.
In this chapter, we understand at once that the prophecy of ver.
I was conditional, we are equally sure that those of5, 6 were not.
Ezek.

“ WhenI say untothe wicked, Thou shalt surely die;
and thou givest him not warning.

to save his life.’

ἀναβαθμοί] Usedin two senses, forthe whole dial, or set of steps, and for the intervals upon it, or separate steps.

ABBREV The exact nature of the contrivance is not known.
The commentators discuss the question of the miracle, how it was wrought, and many of them, as to whether there was any miracleat all.
All that need behere asserted is, that the Almightycanboth alter or reverseanyprocess of nature, however mighty or complicated, and also enable this or that man, or all men, to perceive sucha deed,or prevent them from perceiving it.

This Song of Hezekiah, which does notoccur in Kings, is preserved by some copies of the LXX.

Ev τῷWm] Heb.
literally‘ in the quiet’ or‘ stillness’:
some take‘ the noonday,’‘ zenith’( Kay, Cheyne,c.
):
Delitzsch as‘ the peaceful course.’
Lxx.

For the Lxx.
text cf.

but there Heb.
has not the verb, and something mustbe supplied:
here Lxx.
omits it, but the sentence can be rendered without it.
καταλείψω] Heb.
‘ I am deprivedof,’ punished in the matter of.

As the Heb.
verb ABBREV generally‘ visit,’ means in one of its voices to‘ commit a trust( or deposit)to.

11.
τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ] Perhaps intended to interpret Heb.
JAH( repeated).
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς] Β reads ἐπὶ γῆς ζώντων, οὐκέτι μὴ ἴδω τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ γῆς, which seemstobea duplicate, with the exception of ζώντων, whichQmg has with asterisk, and though the source is not stated, it maybe Hexaplaric.
ℵ * AQ*V and about 20 cursives, Lucianic and others, omit the words:
which omission might, apart from the general evidence, have been taken for an oversight from the ﬁrst to the second ἐπὶ γῆς.
ζώντων may indeed have been lost in this way.
ἄνθρωπον] After this, QWV and many cursives have ἔτι μετὰ κατοικούντων from Theodotion.
This corresponds to Heb.
‘ with the’ After thisthe MSS.
generally, except ℵAQΓ 49 86 198 239 306, have ἐξέλιπεν.
which comes again from Theodotion, clearly correspondingto Heb.

In the Canticle,T has ζώντων, otherwise AT omit ζώντων.

‘a circle,’ cf.

10.
ἐξῆλθεν καὶ ἀπῆλθαν]Colourless verbs:
Heb.
‘ is pluckedup and carried away’( like a captive).
The former is however used simply for ‘ remove’ or‘ depart.’
ὅσπερ ὅ καταλύων σκηνὴν]B's order, σκήνην καταλύων, apparently with Heb.
, as usually.
The participles are not easytoaccount for, καταλύων perhaps taking ABBREV to be fromm πήξας possibly with some confusion of the Greek verb's meanings:
it applies in a sense well enough toa‘ tent,’ but Heb.
has no suggestion of sucha meaning here.
Perhaps Lxx.
read ABBREV as Nap, which hasthe senseof‘ freeze,’‘ set hard,’ and its noun ABBREVis rendered by πάγος in Zech.
xiv.
The want of sense is not surprising;
πήξας after καταλύων isoddand suspicious.
Lxx.
probably found a difficulty in the active verb ABBREV ‘1 have rolled up.’
The clausesare differently divided from the Heb.
, and the sense is lost.
ἐς ἱστὸς] ἱστὸς here= the‘ web,’ as though ABBREV( participle=‘ weaver’) were pointed ABBREV τὸ πνεῦμά μου stands for Heb.
‘ my life.
The next words seem to be a guess on the partof LXX.
, inserted to givea connection:
ἐκτεμεῖν corresponding, except in syntax, to ABBREV Heb.
has only the intervening word ABBREV whichA.
V.
renders‘ with pining sickness’:
better, as A.

, ‘ from the thrum, ’ i.
e.
the end of the used- up thread.
13.
ἐν τῆ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ] Heb.
has here, as again below, ‘ from day to night.
παρεδόθην] This word, as we have seen, on xxiii.
7, c.
( Vol.
I.
Introd.
p.
50) is frequently usedby mm.
with doubtful propriety.
Here, and at the endof the verse, it seems to correspond to ABBREV‘ thou wilt make an end of me’;
and as ABBREV has the senses of ‘ be at peace,’‘ complete,’‘ render’( as avow), and almost, as in Arabic( see Cheyneonxlii.
19)‘ devote,’‘ surrender,’ the use of the word is not altogether unreasonable here.
LXX.
, on this supposition, omit‘I quieted myself,’ for which some would read‘I cried,’ ABBREV for ABBREV.

ὃς ἐξείλατο] Heb.
‘I am oppressed,’ ABBREV whereas the Greek seems to represent some such verb as.
ABBREV ABBREV or ABBREV The two parallel verbs with different compounds resemble ἐξῆλθεν καὶ ἀπῆλθεν above, and perhaps indicate that Lxx.
are trying to gloze overa difficulty.
καλ ἀφείλατό μου] Heb.
‘ be suretyfor me,’ ABBREV which seems have been read by Lxx.
as ABBREV takenas causal, Hiphil ABBREV‘ took away, ’ 15.
The principal Mss.
of LXX.
omit this verse altogether.
It is supplied from Theodotion, inV.

οἱ ἐν ᾅδου] Lxx.
abandon the attempt at three parallels;
this phrase stands the ﬁrst timefor‘ Sheol,’ the secondtime for‘they that go downtothe pit.

The latter part of the verse is paraphrased.
Possibly the translator was thinking of Hezekiah 's supposed childlessnessupto the timeof his illness.

rendered loosely by ἐλεημοσύνην at end of previous verse.

In Kings, these verses stand after ver.
6, and many modern authorities consider them misplaced here.
The pluperfects ofA.
V are objectedto, on grammatical grounds.
Α wide view as to corresponding usages of language may be needed to justify them:
but the order of’s narrative is not bound to conform to modern ideas of arrangement.

The description of’s disease has suggestedtosome the plague, supposed therefore to bethe same that destroyed Sennacherib's army.
The evidence is lacking in either case.
Leprosy( Lev.

Certainly this disease was especially to be regarded as directly inflictedby God,and asatype of sin, clinging and consuming, or removed.

This Merodach hada small principality inS.
Babylonia, starting from which, by constant struggles, he made himself king of Babylonia, in the ancient capital.
Under Sargon he maintained himself as a nominal but disobedient vassal of Assyriafor eleven years, when he openly revolted:
thenceforward he carried on intrigue and warfare fora long time, but seemsto have reigned at Babylon again only for a few months during’s reign, until finally crushed by him.
His adventurous career lasted for something like thirty years;
some authorities assign the later events of it toason bearing the same name;

This practice is more common in other parts of the Bible, especially Kings, than in the Prophets.
Theodotion was much given to it(see Swete, Introd.
to 0.
T.

The Heb.
word, according tothe best authorities, means ‘ treasury’;

Hezekiah ' s fault(2 Chron.
xxxii.
25, 26)was pride, and thathe owed all,his very existence, to God.
His repentance was sincere, and the evil was not to fall in his day;
his son 's doings aggravated the ill beyond earthly pardon.
His answer to Isaiah is simply resigned thankfulness for the postponement.
δικαιοσύνη] See on xxxviii.
19.
XL.
The previous chapter of history has directed our attention to Babylon.
The portion of the Book which follows— chh.
xl.
— lxvi.
, or the greater part of them— has been generally admittedto refer to captivity in Babylonia, and the deliverance from it.
Many modern critics hold, as is well known, that these chapters were composed by an unknown prophet( or prophets), long after’s death, toward the close of the Exile— some portions, indeed, later again.
allege differences of style, language, and standpoint, between these chapters and those which they acknowledge as Isaiah's work;
consider it unlikely or impossible that he should have looked so far intothe future,and away fromhis own time;
with so much detail, moreover,as to mention Cyrus by name.
The question is too wide and complicated for discussion here:
and it is not necessary for our immediate purpose toenter upon it, as the Greek translator shows no sign of any idea thatthe sixty- six chapters of the book are not alike Isaiah's work.
Nor, it may be noticed, does the author of Ecclesiasticus.
The ﬁrst doubt on the subject seems to have been expressed by lbn Ezra in the twelfth century A.
D.
;
and not again until the eighteenth century, when the modern views were put forward by the German schoolofwhom Gesenius, Hitzig and Ewald are the chief names.
These views are probably held, in oneformor another, by a majority of the authoritiesand students ofthe present day.
It is per- haps therefore proper for the writer of these notes to state that he is not convinced by them, but holds that, substantially, the whole of the‘ Book of Isaiah’ is the workof that prophet, and that the workofthe modern‘ critics,’ while of immense value as a contribution to knowledge of details, is a failure as to thebroad issues involved.
1.
παρακαλεῖτε τὸν λαόν μου] The Heb.
is transitive( Piel);
the rendering of Α.
V.
is correct, and the punctuation shouldbe observed.
The vocative in Vulg.
, consolamini, popule ms, opens the door to some confusion.
The persons addressed are perhaps the prophets;
or, indeed,all who hearthe message.

similar in form ABBREV.
περιεχρύσουν] The Heb.
word is akin to that used above for‘ smelter’ χρυσοχόος).
Lxx.
omit‘ silver chains.’
The passageis difficult.
ὁμοίωμα] Heb.
begins a fresh verse at this point, with the obscurephrasenoiwn pom, of which the best rendering forthcoming is,‘ He that is impoverished as to an offering.’
The not.
throws no light on this as it stands.
Prof.
Skinner suggests that ABBREV was read by them as ABBREV‘ likeness’;
but the order of words is against this:
and it is perhaps more probable that ὁμοίωμα is due to the context, either beinga guess for 13073.
1, or having taken the place of the rendering of it:
and that κατεσκεύασεν represents ABBREV read perhapsas town, from ABBREVin sense‘ set’ ABBREV is itself com- pletely obscure, Vulg.
rendering the phrase‘ Forte lignum et imputri- bile,’ and Jerome explaining the word of durable wood! 20.
ξύλον.

Heb.
‘ that sitteth upon.’
καμάραν] Heb.
ABBREV,‘ ﬁne cloth,’‘ gauze,’ is closely connectedwith the word usedin ver.
15 for ‘ dust. ’
23.
The syntax differs from Heb.
,‘ judges’having been transferred,asa verb, tothe first clause, with some misreading.
εἰς οὐδὲν ℵAQ is nearer than ὡς ofB:
the confusion is easy, cf.
e.

17.
οὐδὲν represents here tohu,‘ waste,’‘ chaos,’‘ confusion,’ and so, nothingness.
24.
σπείρουσιν ofA must be wrong:
σπεροῦσιν was probably intended, but most MSS.
have this and the next verb in aor.

The Heb.
has passive verbs, but one being Niphal ofa verb beginning with ABBREV, and theothera Pual, they do not differ in the consonantal text from active forms.
25.
ὑψωθήσομαι] Heb.
‘I shall be like,’ from ABBREV).
LXX.

perhaps confusion with the ﬁrst word of ver.

κατέδειξεν] So in xli.

There is also the possibility that ἦ( or ἢ)may have beentheoriginal text.

exactly, but asin various expressions,is almost alternative, =‘ or.
The general meaning is clear.
If the trialof foreknowledge,or any knowledge, is too much, at least let these ‘ gods’ show their power to do something of some sort.
This whole passage seems decisive against those who deny or minimize the predictive element in prophecy.
The claim, at least,is unmistakable,and those who reject it have equal grounds for rejecting what else they please in Scripture.
The prophets, who interpret God'sthoughtsand purposes, must ipsot facto look beyond the past and the present moment.

ABBREV But ABBREV is not used withthe previous object, which indeed is not expressed:

ἐρχέσθωσαν] Also made plural, ἄρχοντες being taken as the nominative Cyrus belonged to Elam, in theΕ.

The reference, however, need not be to him individually.
The syntax of the latter part of theverseis altered, and οὕτως καταπατηθήσεσθε is added by Lxx.
to complete the sense, as they took it.

is the usual word for ‘ righteous’:

probably comes near the meaning here.

omit the next participle, which is the causal of the verb for‘ hear’ this follows in its simple form, whence,no doubt, the omission.

cf.
ver.
24;
perhaps taken from thence, and the extra negative added before ἀποκριθῶσιν to make sense.
‘A word’ is not in LXX.

This verse is at least incomplete in Lxx.
οἶ ποιοῦντες·
ὑμᾶς corresponds to‘ their works,’ but differs in voice, as if without initial and with ABBREV for ABBREV After εἰσὶν γὰρ something is missing, to render ‘ vanity’:
μάτην alone stands in the place of‘ wind and wasteness( tohu).
οἱ πλανῶντες ὑμᾶς( again with 2nd pers.
for 3rd pers.
suffix) should correspond to ABBREV‘ their molten images.’
This conceivably be due to reading ABBREV‘ they that scatter you,’ ABBREV‘ they that turnyou aside.’
But Symmachus(probably) οἱ πλάσσοντες,and it is possible that this was also the LXX.
, and has been corrupted:
‘ they thatform’ you, as if by fusing or casting.

] The discrepancy Heb.
and Lxx.
here is well known, and the quotation, Matt.

In the first place, Heb.
has no mention here of‘ jacob’ and‘ Istael.’
Scholz supports Lxx.
here, holding that theM.
T.
has been altered, and that LXX.
have“ die schwierigere, und darum kritisch gesicherte Lesart”:
but probably few will agree him.
The names might easily have come in from other passages, as xli.
8, xliv.
I, 2;
whereas their omission from Heb.
would be difficult to explain, as it would be an unlikely accident, and in view of other passages,a futile expedient, if intentional. ’
s quotation is here mainly with Heb.
;
the resemblance to Theodotion's version, to which Prof.
Swete refers( Introd.
to O.
T.
in Greek,p.
395), is only marked in εὐδόκησεν, and inthelast clause, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν, Matthew agrees, except for ἐπὶ, with LXX.
εἷς νῖκος is however found in Theod.
( and Aq.
also, xxv.

, as 2 Sam.

, with special reference to the quotations in Justin, Dial.
Tryph.
123, 135.
These agree with Lxx.
in inserting Ἰακώβ, Ἰσραήλ,and in some other respects, while varying generally between Lxx.
and the text as given in’s quotation.
In estimating the evidence of Patristic quotations of the passage, the question must be taken into account, whether they quote from Isaiah or Mat.
thew, or confusethe two.
It is worth whileto notice Tertullian, adv.
Praxean, who is decidedly against LXX.
;
Accipe igitur et alias voces patris de filio per Esaiam:
Ecce filius mus quem elegi, dilectus mat:
in quem bane semi.
The conclusion seems to be, with regard to the main quotation:
(a) that LXX.
are wrong in inserting Ἰακώβ.
.
.
Ἰσραήλ:
(b) that Matthew quoted either loosely from Heb.
and Lxx.
alternately, or from an older form of Lxx.
, which Theodotion may have used.
( This is more likely than an alternative Hebrew:
but’s source may have beena loosely put together collection of prophecies):
(c) that later quotationsofthe passage are likelyto be confused, either originally or in transcrition from the three main sources, Isai.
Heb.
, Isai.

4 this has some verbal resemblance to the present clause, so that Matthew might conceivably have dropped into Habakkuk's wording.
The two expressions, at any rate, come near to touching one another at this point:
but as Heb.
and met.
agree, it neednot be further discussed here.
Justin quotes once with ἀλήθειαν and once with νῖκος.
4.
ἀνακάμψα.
.
.
οὐ θραυσθήσεται]Lxx.
substitutes a positive expression for Heb.
‘ he shallnot burn dimly’:
the two expressions‘ burn dimly,’‘ be bruised,’ being repeated in Heb.
from ver.
3.
To Vulg, and A.
V.
give no clue.
καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ όνόματι αὐτοῦ ἔθνη ἐπλιοῦσιν] It is doubtful Whether this clause in Heb.
is independent, or still subordinate to‘ until,’ but the former view is perhaps more usual.
Here( see above)Matthew practically agrees with LXX.
, and so Justin, with ὄνομα, ἔθνη for‘ law,’‘ isles.
Aq.
Symm.
Theod.
have νόμος, νῆσοι.
ἔθνη is used above for‘ isles.
Dim, xli.
5:
and ὀνόματι is possibly corrupted from νόμῳ.
More likely it isa paraphrase, cf.
xxvi.
8, lxiii.
16, 19.
Dr Hatch, in his discussionof the passage, remarks that the agreement of early recensions of the Lxx.
“ seems to point toa lost variantinthe Hebrew text.
” is perhaps more thanthe facts indicate.
5.
στερεώσας] Heb.
ABBREV ‘ to beat out,’ asinto thin plates, but a further notionof‘ compacting,’ or at least preserving compactness.
The Lxx.
generally use στερεόω, στερέωμα, for this verb and noun;
and from the Lat.
firmamentum comes our rendering in Gen.
i.
7, c The same verb is usedin XI.
19, of the plating over of the idol.
It is perhaps this view of the word that led to the rendering πήξας just above, where Heb.
is strictly‘ stretched out.
6.
εἰς ᾠοῖς ἐθνὼν]Β* omits.
Cf.
xlix.
6, 8.
8.
ἀρετὰς] Here andin ver.
12, used much in the sense of Lat.
laudes=praiseworthy deeds.
There is none like Him, or approaching Him.
The heathen sometimes groped after this idea:
e.
g.
Aesch.
Agam.

ἀνατεῖλαι] So AQ 26;
ἀναγγεῖλαι isthe usual reading, but pretty clearly due to carelessnessor early corruption, and perhaps corrected again.
Cf.
xlv.
8.
ἐδηλώθη] Heb.
has causal of ABBREV which is often rendered inexactly.
10 ἡ ἀρχὴ αὐτοῦ] ἀρχὴis almost certainly, as Scholz gives it, ABBREV=‘ his beginning’for ABBREV‘his praises.’
What tobethe intention of the phraseis another question:
perhaps ‘ His is the dominion’:
or possibly, more prosaically, asa direction, beginning of it, ’ i.
e.
of the song.
δοξάζετε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ appears to be a duplicate rendering with the right reading:
ℵ* omits the words.
11.
εὐθρανθητι] Perhaps ABBREV for ABBREV Cf.
xxxv.
I.
κῶμαι] LXX.
seem to have thought that the‘ wilderness’ could not contain‘ cities.’
It is doubtfulwhether‘ Sela,’ if taken, with R.
V.
, as a proper name— cf.
xvi.
I, is to be identified with Petra or not.
also 2 Kings xiv.
7.
Delitzsch takes the ‘ Rock- city’ to be a instance of the cities meant:
others think that settlements in the cases are referred to.
13.
συντρίψει πόλεμον] Scholz gives‘ likea man ofwar’ as matterin Heb.
But Mr Thackeray has pointed out( foam.
of Theol) Studies, July 1903) that this phraseis used where Heb.
has‘amanof war’ also in Exod.
xv.
3, the Greek Isaiah and Exodus showing certain affinities.
( For the ideaexpressedby the Greek, cf.
Ps.
xlvi.
9 lxxvi.
3.
) It is thereforescarcely needful to suggest that Lxx.
read ABBREV‘shall trample on,’‘ subdue,’ for ABBREV‘ likea 14.
ἀεὶ] Corresponds to Heb.
‘ from ofold’:
and so Vulg.
semper.
The rhetorical question is not in Heb.
, though, with some confusion, the Hiphil prefixof the first verbmay have been read as the interrogative sign.
Lxx.
are, however,very occasionally, prone to enliven the style of the original:
see lxv.
24, ἐρῶ Τί ἐστίν.
ἐκστῆσαι] Heb.
verb means‘ astonish’as well as‘lay waste.’
dissipato.
R.
V.
however takes this and following verbas intrans.
;
‘I gasp and pant.
15.
The ﬁrst part of this verse is omittedin LXX.
, according to ℵAQΓ 26 41 49 91 106 198 :
B ἃς.
have it inserted from the Hexapla( Symm.
Theod.
).
16.
ῥήματα] Heb.
131 signifyinga‘ thing,’‘ matter,’ as well asa‘ word‘( haec verba Vulg.
).
This is sometimes imitated in the Greek;
compare λογόν, x.
22, 23, with πράγματα, xxviii.
22.
17.
αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀπεστράφησαν.
.
.
ὀπίαω] This clause is referred by LXX.
to the τυφλοὶof ver.
16, witha resemblance toi.
4, where it will be noted that Lxx.
omitted the similar clause.
In Heb.
it refers to the idolaters, the verse being complete in itself:
which seems clearly rig ht.
ght.
18.
ιδεῖν] Heb.
inf.
with 5.
19.
καὶ τίει] καὶ seems to have something of its classical force with the interrogative:
‘ Ναγ, who.
.
.
?’ The English‘ and’ has a similar tendency:
e.
g.
Spenser, Faerie Queene, Bk II.
Canto viii.
l.
1, “ And is there carein heaven?and is there loveIn heavenly spirits,” spirits,& c.
“ or Byron,“ And wilt thou weep, whenIam low?’ οἱ κυριεύοωγες αὐτὸν] Heb.
‘ my messengerthatI send,’ the being probablythe not uncommononebetween ABBREV‘ king and ABBREV‘ messenger.’
Heb.
is clearly right, and the error of Lxx.
probably involved the suppression of‘ thatIsend.’
The nexta very doubtfulonein Heb.
, as to its exact meaning( Who is blindas the surrendered one?) is omittedby LXX.
, Theodotion having τίς τυφλὸς ὡς ὁ ἀπεσχηκώς;
and it is possible that Lxx.
were further confused by the recurrence of‘ blind,’ and an idea that ABBREV meant‘ their ruler.
20.
The numbers and persons of the verbs are changed in Lxx.
21.
ἐβουλεύσατο]Q and most cursivesread ἐβούλετο, which insome ways corresponds better with Heb.
ABBREV‘ was pleased,’ cf.
liii.
the construction with ἵνα after βούλομαι is perhaps awkward, but cf.
, e.
g.
, Mark vi.
25, john xvii.
24.
ἵνα δικαιωθῇ] Either paraphrased, or taken as a verb :
Vulg.
ui sanctificaret cum.
αἴγεσιν] Probably ABBREV read for ABBREV( Lowth).
22.
καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἐγένετο] Ver.
21 in Heb.
ends with‘ and makeit glorious,’‘ 18‘1.
This Lxx.
prob.
read as ABBREV, ‘ and I saw,’ ABBREV‘ and it( is)’ was takenfor ABBREV‘and it came to πεπρονομευμένος καὶ διηρπασμένος] Same Heb.
verbs as in xvii.
14.
ἡ παγὶς] Heb.
is now generallytaken as a verb( infin.
), whose form presents some difficulty, but Vulg.
also read it as a noun with art.
So Vulg.
, laqueus iuvenum, iuvenum being due to taking ABBREV before ABBREV as part of the root:
for ABBREV, see on ἐκλεκτοί, xl.
30.
πανταχοῦ isaloose rendering, apparently to suit ἐν τοῖς ταμιείοις.
It would be possible to punctuate as in Heb.
, with astop after ἐξαιρούμενος, taking ἅρπαγμα as parallel to προνομὴν in construction.
24.
τίς]B reads οἷς, but this gives no sense, and about 25 cursives support ℵAQ, whose text agrees with Heb.
So Cypr.

Seba is saidto be Meroe, high upthe Nile in Ethiopia( near Khartoum), whence legend derived much of the Egyptians’ priestly lore.
Syene( Assouan) wasinUpper Egypt, on the Tropic of Cancer.
Perhaps the geographical knowledge of the translator placed Meroe in the right direction, but did not go far enough.
Scholz suggests that the name lurks, inacorrupted form, in μέρος, vii.

Probably the verb was assimilated to the previous ones, and the unauthorized καὶ strengthens this idea.

B has orderof ﬁnal clausesas in Heb.

ct diamt:
10.
κάγὼ μάρτυς] These words are added here by Mix, and by AQ in ver.
12 also.
Probably they come from a wrong idea of the drift:
interpreted, it may be, in the light of John viii.
18.
12.
ὡνάδισα] Heb.
‘I caused it to be heard.’
The senseof Greek can scarcely be right.
Some, indeed, have suspected that the Heb.
text should have either two, or four verbs:
but Lxx.
are against this.
Perhaps they read ABBREV for ABBREV or should the Greek be ὠνόμασα? Schleusner mentionsa conjecture ἐνώτισα κάγὼ μάρτυς, λίγα Κύριος] See aboveon ver.
10.
NB c.
omit μάρτυς, λέγει, but AQ 26 49 86 106 239 306 have them μάρτυς only, 233).
The intrusion comes from ver.
10, no doubt:
but the original reading here may have been ὑμεῖς ἐμοὶ μάρτυρες, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ ἐγὼ(??) θεὸςκ.

ἀποστελῶ] Heb.

ἐπεγερῶ] ABBREV read for ABBREV according to Scholz.
φεύγοντας] So Heb.
as pointed, RV.
and many authorities.
Others, however, read it( with alteration of vowel- point)as‘ bars’:
Vulg.
water, and Theodotion:
and this A.
V.
interpretes as‘ nobles.’
See onxv.
5.
ἐν πλοίοις δεηθήσονται] ἐν κλοίοις δεθήσονται is the reading of ℵcaA andA's faithful companions 26 and 106.
κλαίοις is howevercertainlya corruption,or rather an alteration, to suit δεθήσονται, which is the reading of all MSS.
but one.
This one, 305, reads δεηθήσονται, which Dr Field printedinhis 1859 edition, pointing out that δέησις is a regular rendering of ABBREV as in jerem.
xi.
14, Ps.

:
Heb.

seems almost conclusive:
else it might have seemed likely that Lxx.

to, or ABBREV cf.
Micah i.
13.
But this is needless, and the nor.
appears to support the Heb.
text.
The passage is so obscure that a historical reference is hardly traceable, more than that some calamity to the Chaldaeansis indicated, previous to the setting free of Israel.

21.
ἀρετὰς] As xlii.
8, 12.
22.
The Greek changes the person( and correspondingly the object)of the verbs, and takesthe second verbas causal.
The difference amounts only to that between ABBREV and ABBREV νῦν] Scholz gives this as ABBREV read for ABBREV 23.
οὐκ ἐμοὶ] Heb.
and the later versions have‘ Thou broughtest not to’:
but the omission of the verb is at least old, see the quotation from Irenaeus below.
οὐδὲ ἐδούλευσας ἐν ταῖς θυσίαις σου] So(ℵ ca) ΑΓ 26( 86 mg) 90 106 198:
omit,ℵ*BQ*c.
The text is doubtful;
ἐποίησά σε below appears inΑ*as εποιηα ε, and itmaybe that ἐδούλευσας.
.
.
ἐποίησας is the true reading,c and ε having been confused and duplicated.
( See Vol.
I.
Introd.
p.
33.
) 24.
Θυμίαμα] So ℵΑQ:
seems on the whole preferable to θυσίασμα(B).
προέστην σου] So ℵAQa:
προέστης μουQ*, and B, which place the words before καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις σου.
This reading agrees better with Heb.
, and the persons of the verbs, as already seen, may have been confused.
Moreover’s order, generally so close to Heb.
, seems right, as προέστης must be ABBREV read as ABBREV Irenaeus( Lat.
transl.
, Adv.
Haer.
IV.
17), gives the passage thus:
non mihi oves holocaustomatis tui nec in sacrificiis clarificasti me:
non servisti mihi in sacrificiis nec aliquid laboriose fecisti in thure.
.
.
sed in beccatis tuis εἰ iniquitatibus tuis anteme stetisti.
This supports Q 's text with addition in ver.

25.
ἀνομίας σου] Β,c.
supply from Symmachus, ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου, in general accord with Heb.
, though the syntax is changed by the καὶ.
A's τὰς ἀδικίας σου at end of verse seems to be another attempt at agreement with Heb.
;
but not in order.
26.
κριθῶμεν] Cf.
i.
18, where Heb.
verb is different.
Vulg.
iudicemur.
τὰς ἀνομίας] Inserted by Lxx.
, but unfortunately against the probable sense.
It is not confession that is demanded:
but an ironic appeal is made for Israel to state her case, merits or claims.

ὁ ἠγαπημένη] So not.
render Heb.
Jeshurun also in the three other places where it occurs:
Deut.
xxxii.
15, xxxiii.
5, 26.
This Heb.
word is connected with Jashar,‘ upright’( cf.
Numb.

used of the nation apparentlyinan ideal aspect, going beyond the name Israel as that itselftranscended Jacob.
Lxx.
here add‘ Israel.’
3.
δώσω.
.
.
ἐπιθήσω] Heb.
each time ‘I will pour.
τοἱς πορευομένας] Prob.
meant to render the word for‘ streams’ or‘ ﬂoods’:
Cf.
xvii.
12, ὕδατος·
φερομένου, xxxii.
2, ποταμὸς φερόμενος, xxx.
25, ὕδωρ διαπορευόμενον, and PS.

ὡσεὶ χόρτος ἀνὰ μέσον ἵδατος] Heb.
‘ in the midstofthe grass.
Here some think that the Lxx.
preserve in their rendering the better text.
It is perhaps more symmetrical :
but this argument cuts both ways.
5.
βοήσεται]Α repeats ἐρεῖ here, by inadvertence.
ἐπιγράφει] ἐπιγράφει MSS.
, except Α.
Β adds χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, based apparentlyon Aq.
Th.
καὶ βοήσεται at the endof verse ℵΒ but omittedby RCAQ,is probablyofthe same kind:
in any casetheparallelism is lost,as Heb.
hasa different verb,‘ shall entitle,’‘ name himself6.
ῥυσάμενος] Heb.
‘ redeemer,’ ABBREV the same wordas the‘ revenger’( of blood)of the Law, Numb.
xxxv.
19, c.
Cf.
xxx.
25.
7.
στήτω] Not in Heb.
mm,‘ asI’, may have been as ABBREV The MSS.
of mm.
show some variety,R reading λαλησάτω for καλεσάτω, ℵAQ omitting καὶ ἀναγγειλάτω.
If once στήτω were inserted, scribes might discover that there was an extra verb, and omitone or other.
ἄνθρωπον] Perhaps intendedas an explanation of‘ the people, taking itas:
mankind.
The rest of the verse is paraphrased.
8.
μὴ παρακαλύπτεσθε] Heb.
‘ Fear ye not’:
the Greek seems express hiding( the face)in dread:
the idea, perhaps,as in ii.
19 Exod.
iii.
6, Revel.
vi.
15, 16.
B c.
add μηδὲ πλανᾶσθε:
Hexaplaric, from Theodotion;
omitted by ℵAQ* 26 41 49 86( not mg) 106 198 239 306.
ἠνωτίσασθε] Heb.
has Ist pers.
of the causal verb,‘ maketo hear.’
καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν τότε] So ℵAwithseventeen cursives, Luc.
29 106 c For ἦσαν Β has ἤκουσαν.
Heb.
has,‘ And there is no Rock:
I know not’ Lxx.
as usual getridof‘ Rock,’ and have shortenedthe verse:
whether ℵ’s text isan attempt at explanation, like οὐκ ᾔδειμεν, xlv.
15, or’s ἤκουσαν represents‘I know not, ’ is hard to Tertullian, dc Idololatr.
4.
, near beginning, has etnon erant tuncquifingunt εἰ exsculpunt.
9, 10.
The two verses begin somewhat alike in Heb.
;
and this seems to have caused Lxx.
to omit, in confusion,a clause of9, and slightly shorten 10, which appears almost as the beginning of9, with πάντες prefixed( not inB)and ἀνωφελῆ instead of μάταιοι ℵcaAQ, or μάταιαℵ*B:
which is of some weight in favour of the neuter.
11.
ἐξηράνθησαν] Heb.
ABBREV, which may have this meaning, as well as that of‘ be’( ABBREV).
This is preferable, because of the order, to explaining the Greek as ABBREV‘ they were dried up’for ABBREV‘his companions.
ὅθεν ἐγένοντο is difficult:
perhaps ABBREV was read as ABBREV;
ABBREV as in Ii.
1, might have been suggested, but there the verb is rendered literally, though active in place of passive.
κωφοὶ] The wordbears this meaning, as well as that of ‘ craftsmen, ’ ‘ workers’:
ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων is literal;
Cf.
παρὰ πάντας ἀνθρώπουςπ.
τοὺς·
υἱοὺς·
τῶν ἀνθρ.
Β), Liii.
3.
ἐντραπήτωσαν] This verb is often used, parallel with‘ be ashamed or‘ be confounded.’
It is herefor ABBREV παρακαλύπτεσθεin ver.
oftener for‘ 23,xlv.
16, Ps.
xxxv.
4, xl.
14, ἃς.
In classical Greek, ἐντρέπομαι isto‘ pay heed’or‘ reverence’:
later, to be‘ put shame, 12.
The details of this passage are less clear than the general drift.
It is usually held that this verse speaks ofa metal- worker, and the next ofa carpenter, fashioning idols in their various ways.
Lxx.
seem not to make this distinction, and thepresent verse in the Greek might be supposed to describe the making of some craftsman's tool.
ὤξυνεν] Not in Heb.
, though some think it representsa lost wordofthe true text:
others think the‘ adze,’ A.
V.
‘ tongs,’ isa mistaken insertion, though Lxx.
has σκεπάρνῳ.
Kay, Delitzsch, δίε.
take‘ craftsman’ and‘ iron’ together, as=ironsmith, blacksmith.
Lxx.
omits‘ in the coals’( supported byQmg, Luc.
MSS.
, 228 309 ἄνθραξι).
ἐν τερέτρῳ ἕτρησεν] Heb.
‘ with hammers,’ probably:
but the means to‘ pierce’ or‘ bore’ through, and Lxx.
probably intends ‘ a gimlet’:
ℵ*B and manycursives have ἔστησεν, ἔτρησεν being reading of ℵcbAQΓ 26 41 49 109 239 305 306 :
and if ἔστησενbe— the verb and noun are not cognate in Heb.
— it perhaps means it ona lathe.’
Gesenius,to illustrate this passage, quoted Virg.
Georg.
IV.
174( cf.
Am.
VIII.
452):
“ llli inter sese magna vi brachia tollunt In numerum, versantque tenaci forcipe ferrum. ’
πεινάσα καὶ ἀσθενήσει] He laboursand“ exhausts his strength in the process:
contrast xl.
31”( Skinner).
The same contrast is in xlvi.
1 – 4.
This passage works out further the idea of XI.
19 foll.
:
just as, e.
g.
, chaps.
ν.
and xxxi.
deal with ideas previously introduced.
13.
ἐκλαξεμενος] This word takes the place of‘ is faint’ at end ver.
12 of Heb.
It may bea guess, cf.
xl.
20.
( Can Lxx.
have read ABBREV for τιν’ and rendered thus?) τίκτων ξύλον corresponds to Heb.
‘ craftsman in wood,’ μέτρῳ to‘ stretcheth outa line.’
If ἐν κόλλῃ ἐρύθμισεν αὐτὸ stands, seems likely, for ‘ marketh it witha pencil,’ the next two clauses omitted by not.
( so Scholz);
but there is so little verbal resemblance that even the correspondence of the clauses is scarcely beyond doubt.
14.
This verse is mutilated in LXX.
, which perhaps skipped from‘ cedars’ ABBREV to the word ABBREV( pine?)found only here, and with some doubt as to the text.
ὃ, in ℵAQ before ἔκοψεν, seems tobean unfortunate insertion, to match ὃ ἐφύτευσεν, and οὗ τὸ ἥμισυ, ver.
16.
ὁ ἐφύτευσεν Κύριος may be an attempt to render some of the missing words of the verse;
but it suggestsa reminiscence of Ps.
civ.
16.
15.
ἵνα.
This is a possible way of rendering Heb.
( pf.
with conversive), though it looks very different fromA.
V.
‘ Then shallit be.
.
.’
It isnot, however,the best way to render αὐτοὺς] After this Lxx.
omit the restof the verse, which practically repeats the preceding clause in parallel phraseology.
On the otherhand, τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν is an insertion;
there seems to be confusion with the beginning of ver.
17.
In fact the rendering of ver.
1517 shows signsof general confusion, and the texts of the principal uncials vary considerably.
For αὐτοὺςQ* reads here αὐτοῖς;
just before, AV 109305have εἰργάσατο, other MSS.
σαντο:
ℵΑQΓ 41 49 106 198 306 insert εἷς before θεοὺς(a Hesychian touch?).
AQ, with whichℵ* nearly agrees, omit ἐπὶ τοῦ ἡμίσους in ver.
16, andBalso has apparentlyaconfused insertion from ver.
19, giving the appearance of a duplicate rendering.
The suggestion that ἐπ’ αὐτῶν isdue to duplicatingABBREV‘ bread,’ as ABBREV( Scholz), is of course possible, but scarcely to be insisted on in the general state of the version.
16.
Field's 1859 edition shows how, from among various Greek equivalent to the Hebrew can be made up, exactly on the principles of’s Hexapla.

Cyrus, descended onone side from the royal line of Persia, is ﬁrst knownas king of Anzan,a petty kingdomin Elam.
He conquered Media, 549 B.
C.
, assimilated the Medians with his other subjects;
appears as king of Media and Persia shortly after:
conquered Croesus of Lydiaby 540, and Babylon 538.
Thus the Medo- Persian Empire arose, succeeding to the dominating position formerly held by Assyria and Babylon.
The name Cyrus is said to mean ‘ shepherd’ in Elamitic.

Unless βέλτιον can be regardedasa paraphrase,it would seem that LXX.

κατεσκεύασα]The syntaxis changed,and this appears to correspond to ABBREV,‘ him that formed him,’ or, as below,‘ the potter,’ κεραμέως to‘apotsherd with potsherds,’ the second word beingof the worker insteadof the work, which LXX.
, dealing witha consonantal text, were free to do.
Between this and τὴν γῆνhas come in,asa duplicate, ὁ ἀροτριῶν ἀροτριάσει, which either suggested the remembrance of xxviii.

But what is the drift? Kay makes this second clause depend on the ﬁrst:
‘ Ask me.

Prof.
Davidson, in the brief note on this passage in theTample Bible, put a stop after‘ things to come’;

This however leavesa sense of something not quite like Hebrew:
and Prof.
Cheyne has pointed out that the sense given to the Heb.
‘ command,’ ABBREV is not exactly paralleltothe instances given.
He would read imperfect for the imperative‘ Ask,’ and render‘ Will ye question me.

formula:

στενάξατε] The Heb.
word, which is obscure, is ABBREV, which some have connected with Ish,‘ man’;
‘ show yourselves men,’ Others assignitto a root meaning ‘ be ﬁrm’( so Delitzsch,R.
V.
marg.
).
Vulg.
has confundamini or fundamini.
Lowth interpreted confundamini as‘ take shame to yourselves,’= ABBREV cf.
Gen.
ii.
25 Lagarde proposed to emend Heb.
here accordingly.
Others have suggested ABBREV,‘ understand,’‘ consider,’ as in xliii.
18.
It seems, however, from’s commentary, that either fundamini should be read, or the compound taken in that sense.
What LXX.
read is not clear.
As Heb.
does not occur elsewhere, στενάξατε maybea guess:
ABBREV,‘ fall to mourning,’ has been suggested by Lowth:
also ABBREV.
Possibly, LXX.
read ABBREV( Zeph.
ii.
I, and see note on xxxiii.
4), taking the sense as resembling viii.
9.
In that casethe original LXX.
would have been συνάχθητε, which would have been corrupted to στενάχθητε, and then alteredtothe middle.
But no certainty seems attainable.
μετανοήσατε] Scholz marks this as not in Heb.
:
LXX.
has certainly a verb more than Heb.
, and ἐπιστρέψατε would naturally represent ABBREV The order, however, would leadus to expectaverb where μετανοήσατε stands:
and it seems to be an explanatory rendering of ABBREV in the sense of‘ turn’;
ἐπιστρέψατε being also inserted, to suit τῇ καρδίᾳ, asa duplicate.

‘ ye rebels’ or‘ transgressors.’
LXX.

has missed the drift, and thoughtit needful to cancel the negative.
If they read anything different, it isnot clear what.
Πᾶσα] Not in Heb.
βεβούλευμαι] Heb.
is not cognatewiththe word rendered βουλή.
Either the writers of MSS.
, or the translators, seem to have been careless in distinguishing certain forms of βουλεύω and βούλομαιι see note on xlii.
21.
The difference in meaning, however,is near vanishing- point in some passages.

the phrase has probably been worked up balance ἀντιστηριζόμενοι.

οὐκ ἔγνωτε mightbe taken as interrog.

πέπρακά σε] Heb.
‘I have refined thee’ of course by though Delitzsch connects the verb FD? with Arabic,“ to turn, wind, wring out,” and deniesit all connectionwith ABBREV,‘ burn.’
Yet it difficult not to suspect that πέπρακα conceals an original πέπρακα from πίμπρημι, and was alteredbya scribe who took the meaning to be‘I have not soldtheefor money.’

” asserts similarly that the suffix- pronoun inthe Heb.
cannot be soco- ordinated, and claims the support of Heb.
accents, and of the Targum, which latter Cheyne considers probable but not certain.
Lowth quotes Origen( adv.
σεῖε.
I.
) and translates with intentional ambiguity.
Calvin, Vitringa, Henderson, Alexander, Knobel, Gesenius, Hitzig, Ewald, Delitzsch, Cheyne( doubtfully,and he appears to suspect the passage), Davidson( note in Temple Bible), Skinner, and W.
E.
Barnes all take the Heb.
as‘ hath sentmeand His Spirit( obj).
Prof.
Driver seems, with some hesitation, to favour the opposite view:
see his note in Isaiah,‘ Men of the Bible’ Series,p.
207.
It should be noted, that thosewho make‘ Spirit’the subject,rely mainly on the ordinary grammar, and usual arrangement of sentence( Delitzsch instances only xxix.
7 asa parallel,and Kay denies it);
those who makeit the object, do soon theological grounds, that the Spirit mustbethe sent, not the sender( instancing 1 Kings xxii.
21, 22 and chap.
xliv.
3, lxi.
1, lxiii.
10, 11).
This view, however,has difficulties of its own:
lxi.

is not veryclear in its influence:
the accounts of the Temptation, Matt.
iv.
1, ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἀνήχθη ὑπὸ τοῦ πνεύματος, Mark i.
12 τὸ πνεῦμα αὑτὸν ἐκβάλλει, should be noted.
If Acts xiii.
2, xvi.
7, may notbe unreservedly quoted, there is also Judg.
xiii.
25.
The list of authorities against making‘ Spirit’the subject is certainly an exceedingly strong one:
yet the rules of language seem thoroughly in favourof it,and the theological arguments not such as to warrantthe forsaking ofthe“literal and grammatical sense. ’
17.
τοῦ εύρεῖν σε τὴν ὁδὸν] εὑρεῖν seems to have been chosen asa verb to suit ὁδὸν, Lxx.
omitting‘ to profit,’ and perhaps rendering the cognate( but causal)verb to‘path’=‘make to tread,’‘ lead.’
It however possible that Lxx.
omitted this cognate, the eyeof the translator straying at this point from ABBREV,‘ to profit,’ to ABBREV, the third word of ver.
18, which might fall just below:
and reading that as ABBREV.
Delitzsch considered that with καὶ νῦν Κύριοι·
κ.
τ.
λ.
, ver.
16, beginsa kind of preludeto chap.
xlix.
and what follows.
This, according to Prof.
Skinner,“ it cannot possibly be”:
and the end of xlviii.

Yet in these verses we do seem to be looking both backand forward, esp.
at the throwing open of the gates in ver.

8):
the secondary authorities are divided;
Vulg.
has the negative, non congregabitur, so have Symm.
and Theod.
;
but Aq.
has none, nor Lxx.
The majority, perhaps,of modems support the margin.
Scholz's note“ ABBREV ABBREV( non congregabitur):
Συναχθήσομαι.
Das ABBREV in ABBREV ist Wiederholung des letzten Buchstabens von‘ Israel’.
” Similarly, if theN were regarded as Ist pers.
prefix( ABBREV), only ABBREV is left unaccounted for in the Lxx.
reading, which is thus explained.
But apparently Dr Scholz considers the Lxx.
preferable, which isa very different matter.
It should be observed that some Luc.
Mss.
, 51 62 90 144 147 233’ 308, read συναχθήσεται, andQ* reads συναχθήσονται,a singular reading on its part which might have been deserving of more attention, were it not that δοξασθήσονται follows.
The ﬁrst verb, however,may be rightly 3rd pers.
sing.
or plural, and the two verbs may have been wrongly assimilated to Ist pers.
in the usual text, and to 3rd pers.
plur.
inQ* the orderofwords tending to bring this about.
The question as to the negative in Heb.
, and the construing of it, remains.
Kay, supporting the negative, argues vigorously, here ason ix.
3, that there was strong reason against its establishing itselfinthe text, unless it had been the true reading.
This, however,seems scarcely valid if we suppose it to have been an error inthe first place, rigidly perpetuated by scribes in the text, but correctedby the tradition, embodied inthe margin.
Further, the antithesisof facob brought again,and Israel not gathered,is unheard of elsewhere:
not even judalz is so pointedly saved at the expenseof Israel.
To keep the negative, we seem bound to take note in another sense, that of‘carried off,’‘ taken away’ as in lvii.
1;
which Prof.
compares Ezek.
xxxiv.
29, and Prof.
Davidson( Temple Bible) adopt.
Otherwise we must read ABBREV, and render,‘ and that Israelbe gathered unto him.

ἀδίκως] Heb.
has‘ of the righteous,’ ABBREV:
a difficult which many wish to alter to ABBREV,‘ terrible,’ asin the answer, ver.
25.
The Syriac( Peshitta), and Vulg.
a robusto, support this, and the mere fact that Lxx.
have ἀδίκως here and ἰσχύοντοςin ver.
25 is not decisive even as to their reading.
Moreover, ἀδικουμένων is used to render γῆν in mm3, 4.
On the otherhand, that renderingis wrong:
and ἀδίκως besides being not exactly whatwe should expectto render ABBREV, is pretty well what Lxx.
might be expected to do with ABBREV, if they felt its difficulty.
Cf.
δύσχρηστος for ABBREV in iii.

( Vol.

yet it is not certain but that the desire for it arises from failure to graspthe argument, and the connection with ver.

and the two clauses may therefore have been thought to be an accidental duplication:
ℵcb 305 306 omit almost the same words.

ἐστερεώθη] This verb does not agree with Heb.
, nor does it seem to suit the context, or even the phrase in which it occurs.
The apparent solidity of smoke seems the only possible idea to attach tothe word,and this does not seem satisfactory.
Schleusner mentionsa conjecture ἐστρώθη, which however, even if accepted, lessens the difficulty but slightly.
The passive, Niphal,ofℵ ABBREV might conceivably have been read for, or confused with, that of ABBREV:
in which case we should have expected ἐπλήσθη or ἐπληρώθη.
Lxx.
might however have fallen backon ἐστερεώθη as easier to use absolutely with ὡς καπνός, the moreas the verbhasalready been used more than once in recent chapters( xlii.
5, xliv.
24, xlviii.
13).
Some of their verbs, however,such as ἀποσβεσθήσεται,x.
18, πληρῶσαι, xiii.
3, and some uses of παραδίδωμι and παρακαλέω( Vol.
1.
lntrod.

ὅσπερ ταῦτα] Vulg.
sicut haec:
A.
V.
‘ in like manner. ’
modern authorities render,‘ like gnats’:
but this can scarcely done, in theopinionof most, without alteration of the text.
Delitzsch, keeping the text, interprets it as=‘ like that,’a contemptuous, phrase, which ordinarily tone and gesture would explain:
instancing the use in Latin comedy of“ huius non facio.
” that’would then mean‘ like—a thing of ἐκλίπῃ]The aorist is prob.
right, after οὗ μή, and ἐκλείπῃ of AQ merely itacism.

8.
ὑπὸ χρόνον] The clauses are inverted.
Heb.
has my,‘ moth,’ which may have been read ABBREV,‘ time,’ or interpreted as that which is‘ edax rerum.
σητὸς] Heb.
ABBREV may be the same word as Greek σῆς.
It occurs only here in the Bible.
ἡ δὲ] δὲ seems here to mark the apodosis( Heb.
ABBREV).
Cf.

13 or 14.
9.
τοῦ βραχ.
σου] Heb.
‘ arm oftheLord.’
The pronoun doubtless substituted, on the insertion by lxx.
of‘ Jerusalem’( cf.
lii.
1, lx.
1).
The last sentence of this verse begins with three words exactly alike, and a fourth word differing by one letter only from the opening words of ver.
10.
Consequently it is not surprising that Lxx.
omitted it, eSpecially as they may have thought it identical also in meaning.
Several cursives supply the words,in various forms, mainly from Theodotion.
On“ Rahab” and“the dragon”see notes on xxvii.

It might be possible to perceiveareason for this,thoughthe difference isasmall one on whichtobuild an idea.
Lowth considered that the plenary writing with- of the previous word, which is not present in xxxv.
Io, represented the missing initial 1.
It is scarcely necessary to add that some modern commentators consider the verse an interpolation here.
B omits ἀγαλλίαμα καὶ.

ℵQ and ninecursives have ἀγαλλίασις.

B, in agreement with the Heb.
, has τίς οὖσα for the nexttwo words:
as has Theodotion.
It may, however,be right.
τίνα might have come from the Heb.
, by transposition, ABBREV for ABBREV but εὐλαβηθεῖσα must be an intrusion from lvii.

ὥς σευτλίον ἡμίεφθον] This discrepancy with the Heb.
is well known and of old date.
Heb.

assuming that ABBREV here is the same as ABBREVin Deut.

‘ An antelope ofa net’is perhaps somewhat obscure for‘ caught in net’:
but not more so, perhaps, than ‘a rain- storm ofa wall,’ xxv.

translate similarly.
Jerome remarks on the passage:
“ Pro beta semicoctareliqui interpretes orygem captumet’ llagueatum transtulerunt;
qui Hebraice dicitur Tho.
.
.
pro quo lxx.
Syra lingua opinati sunt Thoreth quae dicitur beta.’
Prof.
F.
C.
Burkitt suggests that for Thoreth, which does not mean‘ beet’in Syriac oranyknown language, we should read Thomech(a bitter herb used at the Passover):
and that Jerome meant that the translator, having the text woman:
before him, thought of this, and of ABBREV‘ bitter.’
The ingenuityof this guessis manifest:
and it gives support to the Hebrew text.
There is however no clue to the real meaning of the Hebrew, more than that already gained from the other ancient versions:
and the nor.
rendering may not have been rightly accounted for by Jerome.
σευτλίον is puzzling, maybe corrupt, and Dr Alexander suggested that it might bea corruption of some Egyptian word:
ἡμίεφθον, compared with Aquila's ἠμφιβληστρευμένος and Symm.
's ἐν ἀμφιβλήστρῳ, certainly raises suspicion, that it have been corrupted from some compound with ἠμφι-.

, and perhaps duplicates τῶν ἀδικησάντων.
For ἐμβαλῶ( AQ)B has δώσω;
cf.
ἐμβαλῶ in xxxvii.
29, θήσω in the corresponding verse of 2 Kings.
τὰ μετάφρενά σου] This lookslikean explanation,which has turned out τὰ μέσα, read byB, which renders the Heb.
literally.
ἔξω] rm,‘ open place’ or‘ street,’ means‘ without,’‘ abroad,’ accompanied by certain prepositions.
lxx.

τὴν δόξαν σου] Heb.
is almost more‘ beauty’than‘ glory.’
Cf.
Exod.

lxx.

2.
ἔκδυσαι] So RAandseveral cursives;
Q* has ἔνδυσαι, the Luc.
Mss.
ἔκλυσον, andB 109 305( with Qmg) ἔκλυσαι.
This last seems preferable, translating Heb.
more closely, and accountingforthe other readings,Δ andΛbeing easily confused, and ἔνδυσαι having occurred twice in the previous verse.
‘ Loose from thee’ is the Heb.
reading, which seemsto have been generally followed:
so Aq.
Symm.
Theod.
and Vulg.
solve vincula.
The Heb.
text has‘( the bands)are loosed.

4.
βία ἤχθησαν]The termination, 3rd pers.
sing.
as object, has been read as 3rd pers.
plur.
personal suffix, and the verb taken as passive.
Even so, ἤχθησαν is notan exact translation, the Heb.
meaning not‘ led( captive)’ but‘ oppressed.’
Βίᾳ seemsto convey idea of irresponsible tyranny:
the Heb.
expression when followed by a noun means simply‘ without,’ literally,‘ in nothingness.’
the useof βία=‘ in spiteof,’ as Thucyd.

24,, xvii.
4, 6,& c.
θαυμάζετε] Perhaps ABBREV,‘ wonder ye’for ABBREV;
though the seems hardly to be intended as an imperat.
in the Greek.
όλολύζετε] It is generally agreed that the Heb.
verb is not causal( 3rd pers.
plur.
indic.
and 2nd pers.
plur.
imperat.
are alike in consonants).
The Heb.
word is not generally used of joy:
nor is itnecessarilyso here, but of loud noise.
lxx.
insert δι’ ὑμᾶς and ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, perhaps followingoutan independent ideaofthe meaning.
6.
πάρειμι] The Heb.
phrase,a very common one, is exactlyMe voici.
7.
ὅρα] No doubt expresses‘ beauty,’ esp.
that of early prime, as in the spring,&c.
This meaning comes out particularly in adjective.
It has indeed been suggested that ver.
6 should be brought toa full stop, as in Heb.
, after πάρειμι, and ver.

With the force of the expression compare1 Cor.

and the plural is perhaps in its favour, unless both meanings are combined.

θαυμάσονται] The Heb.
is obscure:
some render it, ‘ he shall astonish,’ or,‘ startle many nations’:
of which Lxx.
might seem an inversion.
It was formerly generally taken to mean, ‘ he shall sprinkle’;
so A.
V.
, Vulg.
asperget, Aq.
and Theod.
ῥαντίσει:
Kay Pusey support this, but itis objected thatthe verb means, not to sprinklea person witha liquid,but to scatter as the liquid itself.
It is, however,going rather far to pronounce that the sense cannotbe transferred, as it evidently is in some languages.
Lowth, favouring an emendation, ABBREV,‘ they shall regard,’ quoted Hesiod( Theogonia οἱ δέ νυ λαοὶ πάντες ἐς αὐτὸν ὁρῶσι, and Themistius, Or.

Εἰτα παύσονται οἱ ἅνθρωποι πρὸς σέ μόνον ὁρῶντες, καὶ σὲ μόνον θαυμάζοντες.

in a sense is near Heb.

the word ‘ generation’ perhaps meaningthe period,and the men living in it, i.
e.
contemporaries:
so Gesenius, Cheyne, and Delitzsch, who says that the LXX.
must mean‘ Who can count his posterity? the Heb.
being taken to mean‘ and astohis generation,who considered that he was.

thus used, see Davidson, Syntax,§ 78:
but this passage is not instanced.
Kay translates,‘ And his life who will consider?’a lifetime, that is, so short.
Lowth,‘ And his manner of life who would declare? referring toan alleged custom of inviting witnesses to character before condemnation ona capital charge, and pointing out the bearing of John xviii.
20, 21, and Acts xxvi.
4, 5.
It is, however, denied by most modern authorities that the Heb.
word can mean ‘ course’ or‘manner’ of life, and’s explanation seems to havedroppedout of consideration.
ἡ ζωὴ] Heb.
‘ of the living.
άπὸ τᾶν άνομιῶν] Heb.

ABBREV ἤχθη εἰς Θάνατον] Heb.

cf.
xliv.
15, perhaps Ps.

seem to have read ABBREV,‘ to death’:
some have approved this as an emendation of Heb.

Some think‘ rich’ must, by parallelism with‘ wicked,’ bea term of evil meaning:

Delitzsch thinks it rather to be antithetic:

Some resort to emendation, Ewald reading ABBREV,‘ oppressor,’ for ABBREV,‘ rich’:

however clearly support the Heb.

It is certainly tempting to read, altering the points,‘ his high places,’ to mean,‘ his tomb’;
‘ in his deaths’:
not.

‘ Guile’ in the Heb.

On the other hand δόλον is more likely than not to have been altered to match ἀνομίαν.
Dr Hatch is perhaps right in considering οὐδὲ δόλος the original reading:

with Ewald and Cheyne,a letter must be altered.
ἀφελεῖν] The connectionofthe words differs from Heb.
LXX.
omit‘ in his hand,’ and this inﬁn.
corresponds to‘ shall prosper.’
Whether asa paraphrase, or by reading ABBREVfor ABBREV,the alteration of one letter to ὠφελεῖν would bring the Greek nearer to Heb.
The construction and sense, however, would not, even witha change of punctuation, be improved thereby.
11.
δεῖξαι] Represents‘shall see,’ taken as causal, φῶς beinga supplement on the part of LXX.

παρεδόθη] May be taken the ﬁrst time as a paraphrase for‘he poured out,’ though inverted:
the second time the Heb.

but it can hardly be argued that the occurrence of so Simplea phrase inN.

ABBREV in both cases:

but the Greek is too near to makeit likely that there is corruption.
11.
ἄνθρακα] Generally‘a hot coal,’ but, when speaking precious stones, believed to be the‘ carbuncle,’ whose name has the same meaning.
It more generally corresponds, as Prof.
Skinner points out, to ABBREVthan to ABBREV, which Heb.
has here, and whose meaning is‘ antimony,’ used for painting round the eyes, and herefora setting for the stones.

Yet it can hardly be right, forB's reading σκευαστὸνis confirmed bythe impossible τονofℵ*, which is accounted for by σκευας dropping out after σκεῦος;
also it agrees with the meaning of Heb.
, and imitates, though with different words, the Heb.
assonance in ABBREV.
φθαρτὸν probably was due to φθεῖραι just before:

ἴδετε] The Heb.
text has a verb, which might be thus rendered:

ἐνυπνιαζόμενοι κοίτην] Heb.
has here two participles:
‘ dreaming’( or,‘ raving’) and‘lying down.’
The former, ABBREV, closely ABBREV, ‘ seers, ’ which appears to have been read by Vulg.
( videntes vana)and by Symmachus;
also by a few Heb.
MSS.
Scholz somewhat strangely gives these words, as well as‘ watchmen,’ as addedto the Hebrew text( as though theywerenot rendered by lxx.

24.
τὰ εἴδωλα] Heb.
ABBREV, probably ‘ among the terebinths’:

( best texts) omit‘ Among the smooth( stones)of the torrent,’ the word for‘ smooth,’ plur.
, being from the same root as for‘ portion,’ perhapsa play on wordsin Heb.
It has been doubted whether, as ‘ smooth’may mean‘ slippery,’‘ deceitful’( as in Ezek.
xii.
24), stones are really meant.
But it is most generallyso taken:
Delitzsch refers to Herod.

ἐκεῖ 1°] ABBREV‘ thou hastset’ read as ABBREVor ἀνεβίβασας]Heb.
‘ thou wentest up,’ either takenas causal would need prefixed ABBREV) and the cognate verb to‘ sacriﬁce’ omitted:
or the general sense thus expressed.
8.
ᾤου ὅτι ἐὰν] Heb.
has merely ABBREV, ‘ for, ’ and LXX.
have endeavoured to supply a connection( ABBREV may also mean‘ that,’ or‘ if’).
ℵ reads, for ᾤου, ὡς, which,if it can be translated, must mean,‘ with the idea that if.
.
. ’
:
but it is unsupported.
ἀποστῇς rather strains meaning of ABBREV ‘ to go away’( into captivity), cf.
xvi.
3, which probably not the sense here.
Ezek.
xvi.
25, c,.
looks like amplification of this passage.
πλεῖόν τι ἕξεις] Heb.
‘ thou art gone up,’ ABBREV from ABBREV probably as ABBREV‘it profiteth,’ and paraphrased.
The next two clauses are omitted in the best MSS.
of LXX.
9.
καὶ ἐπλήθυνας τὴν πορνείαν σου μετ’ αὐτῶν] Heb.
has‘ thou hast travelledtothe king with οil.’
There seems no connection between the( ireck and this.
Some duplication suggests itself, or, more likely, that a missing clause of ver.
8 is represented by these words.
Heb.
refers either to sending presents to some sovereign:
cf.
Hosea, xii.
1, ἔλαιον εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐνεπορεύετο, and xxx.
6;
or to offeringstoan idol,‘ Molech’being the same word as‘ king’ with altered vowels.
Delitzsch speaks strongly against this latter view.
τοὺς μικρὸν ἀπὸ σοῦ] Heb.
‘ perfumes,’ ABBREV‘ perfume’being misread as pm‘be far off,’ which occurs later in the verse in form ABBREV where ὑπὲρ τὰ ὅριά σου may be an attempt at variety fora supposed parallelism, or rather repetition.
ἐταπανώθης] The causal form in Heb.
has generally been taken here as though with‘ thyself’for object.
Vulg.
humiliata es.
10.
ταῖς πολυοδίαις] Heb.
would naturally mean‘ much journeying, ’ or, ‘ length of way’ as in Josh.
ix.
13.
ἐκοπίασας]Α different Heb.
word from xlvii.
13.
“ Lassata, necdum satiata,” Juv.
VI.
Παύσομαι] Heb.
‘ It is hopeless.
ἐνισχύουσα ὅτι ἔπραξας ταῦτα] Heb.
obscure, perhaps ‘ thou didst ﬁnd revival of thy strength.’
The Greek shows little[ Can ἐνισχύω here have thesense of ἰσχυρίζομαι,‘ insist strongly’? κατεδεήθης] Heb.
‘ thou wast not faint,’ freely rendered.
σύ, emphatic at the end, comes from the ABBREV at the beginning of ver.
II 11.
ἐψεύσω με] Heb.
verb is absolute, without obj.
:
cf.
i.
3.
εἰς τὴν διάνοιαν οὐδὲ] Not in Heb.
ἰδὼν] ΑBBREV for ABBREV suggests itself( no partic.
of ABBREV with ABBREV seems to occur).
Or σε ἰδὼν may beacorruption of σειγων,i.
e.
σιγῶν.
παρορῶ] Pointing the Heb.
word ‘ from of old’ asa participle,with ABBREV inserted,‘ turning away’( the eyes?).
The Greek verb has same ambiguity as‘ overlook’in English,but generally means not to see.
So Vulg.
quasi non widens.
12.
κακὰ] interpreting Heb.
‘ thy works,’ cf.
Lxx.
of xliii.
The‘ righteousness’is spurious.
ℵ*B read δικ.
σου, but ℵca cbAQ* and twenty cursives δικ.
μου, altering the sense.
13.
ἂν τῇ θλίψει σου] Reading ABBREV( or ABBREV)for ABBREV‘thy gatherings,’ i.
e.
collections( of καταιγὶς]Parallelism has led LXX.
to putaword of violence rather than of slightness[ or could theyhave read ABBREV?].
Heb.
‘ a breath.
14.
Καθαρίσατε] Heb.
‘ cast up!’ repeated.
Perhaps ABBREV( cf.
Ps cxix.
9) read by LXX.
( That they couldhave connected it with ABBREVand taken itofstarting the road, as in lxii.
10, seems less likely.
) ἀπὸ προσώπου] Taking ABBREV‘ clear’( a way)for ABBREV‘ face’( same root), which would usually have some preceding preposition.
The second ABBREV may have been misread.
Ἅγιος ἐν ἁγίοις] Heb.
simply ‘ holy, ’ but the phrases in the context may account for LXX.
's amplifying.
Many think that ‘ Holy’ rightlya title,not an attribute of‘ name.
The rest of the verse is somewhat changed.
διδοὺς ζωὴν corresponds to the second‘ to’of Heb.
If διδοὺς be taken then as corresponding to the ﬁrst‘ revive,’ ὀλιγοψύχοις represents‘ crushed andhumblein spirit,’ μακροθυμίαν‘the spirit of the humble,’ and καρδίαν συντετριμμένοις‘the heart of the crushed ones.’
Lxx.
are apt to lose exactness when dealing with passages in which thesame words recur, as here.
16.
ἐκδικήσω] Rather‘ punish,’ thanas Heb.
‘ contend.’
Vulg.
litigabo.
πνοὴν πᾶσαν ἐγὼ ἐποίησα] πᾶσαν isnot in Heb.
, which has plur.
, not found elsewhere, and does not express the relative.
Vulg.
flatus ego faciam.
17.
βραχύ τι] Reading ABBREV‘ of his gain,’ without ﬁnal ABBREV as meaning‘a little,’ according to Lowth:
but of this the Lxx.
appears be the only confirmation.
ἐλύπησα.

ἐλυπήθη] Heb.
‘I was wroth’in both places:

παρεκάλεσα] Reading ABBREV for ABBREV‘I will lead him.

14) instead of‘ mourn.
καὶ τοῖς παθεινοῖς αὐτοῦ, supplied in ngV 62 90 144( 147) 233 308 from Theodotion, is thusa duplicate.

Cyprian has tuba twice, Lucifer perhaps tubae.
The evidence for accus.

the dative seems best attested as the original and harder reading.

concupiscunt, but the Latin evidence is less decisiveon sucha point.

a construction not uncommonin Heb.

simply suggesting the action, which is perhaps the original principle of the imperative itself.

paraphrases with unusual boldness in the latter part of this verse.

‘ opening to the bound’:
the word for ‘ opening’ being acurious reduplicated form, printed,according to tradition, as two words.

20.
) The ordinary form of the word is used of opening, specially, the eyes( or ears);
as xxxv.

hence Lxx.
naturally took it so here, and τυφλοῖςis either intended to explain‘ bound,’ regarded asa meta- phorical phrase( mpti οψθλισ), or dueto reading ABBREV‘ blind’ for ABBREV‘ bound’as Del.
apparently thinks.

evidently give no support to the idea.

‘ bright- red of garments.
the adjective being more exactly a participle ofa verb‘ to be bitteror‘ piercing,’ and hence, probably, vivid of colour.
Evidently, from what follows, there is something strange and striking in the appearance.
οὗτος ἀραῖος] Perhaps οὗτος, as read by 41 48 62 87 93 106 147, is the right text :
for ὡραΐος, Vulg.
gives formosus, Tertull.
decorus Originally the word means‘ swelling,’ the word used of the“ tumid hills” in xlv.
2;
the word is akin to that in Ps.
civ.
1 εὐπρέπειαν.
Βίᾳ μετὰ ἰσχύος] Lxx.
omit the word ‘ travelling’( so A.
V.
):
which is that used in Ii.
14( Heb), in the sense of bowing down.
Gesenius and Cheyne render,‘ tossing the’:
Delitzsch,‘ bending,’ or‘ swaying to and fro,’ with which idea we may perhaps compare the phrase in Judg.
ix.
9, 11, 12,‘ to wave to and fro(?) over the trees.
Lxx.
κινεῖσθαι, Heb.
rm.
Vulg.
has gradiem, which some think represents not am, but ABBREV.
βίᾳ corresponds to ABBREV, with greatness( of strength):
but possibly ABBREV was taken as ABBREV= ABBREV as later in the verse:
‘ strife,’ and so‘ violence’:
Tertull.
has’ olmta cum’ tua’z’ ne.
κρίσιν] Here ABBREV, mighty,is clearly taken as ABBREV or ABBREV a‘ suit’or strife,and then, according to one development of the’s meaning,a judgment or decision.
Tertullian omits this clause.
2.
ἐρυθρὰ τὰ ἱμάτια] Heb.
has‘ Why is therered on thy’ πατητοῦ]Q reads πατήματος, which might bea marginal noteto show how πατητοῦ should be taken.
But Cypr.
Epist.
lxiii.
7 has veluta’ one’s:
Jerome,on this passage, sicut calcantium Iorcular.
ληνὸς seems to be by implication feminine in the next clause:
but πατητοῦ might be regarded as of two terminations.
3.
πλήρης καταπεπατημένης] LXX.
have omitted‘ alone’:
πλήρης corresponds in place to‘ wine- trough,’ which isa different word from‘ winepress’in ver.
2, and occurs elsewhere only in Haggai ii.
16.
The only way to translate, if the verses be divided as in the Heb.
, will be, ‘(I am)full with the trodden( press).’
So( see Vol.
I.
p.
34) Sabatier on this passage quotes from Nobilius,“ id est, oppletus sum,’ which he gives asa rendering with reserve as to the of the text.
But ℵQmg,and several cursives, read πλήρους.
Cyprian 's quotation continues( torccularis)pleni et conculcati, while Tertullian has sicut dc fora’:
piano conculcato, and JerOme tormlar plenum conculcatum.
This evidence seems to converge in favour of reading πλήρους καταπεπατημένης, and carrying down the sentence to that point.
The evidence for πλήρης however is very strong:
and it is possible that whereas a genitive seems preferable, πλήρης may be taken as indeclinable.
See Hort, Introd.
to NT.
in Greek, Appendix,p.
24, on Mark iv.
28, where he suggests that πλήρης is to be read, as indeclin able, there and in Acts vi.
5( where A hasit also in ver.
3).
SoΓ reads πλήρης in1.
15, andBin Ii.
20;
cf.
A, in 2 Kings vi.
17.
If then we place the stop after καταπεπατημένης, and regard πλήρης as genit.
, the resulting sentence is no doubt incoherentand ill- balanced.
But this is not decisive againstit, and the evidence is considerable that it was so taken in ancient times.
κατεπάτησα.
.
.
κατέθλασα.
.
.
κατήγαγον] There is general agreement that the Heb.
verbs are to be treatedas past,the vowel- points being, if necessary, altered to makethe ABBREV conversive( consecutive).
But can they not be regardedas frequentative?For the repeated preposition, cf.
Aesch.
Agam.
1410, ἀπέδικες, ἀπέταμες, ἀπόπολις δ’ ἴση( MSS.
ἄπολις):
and 1553, κάππεσε, κάτθανε, καὶ καταθάψομεν.
κατέθλασα] See below, on ver.
6.
ὥς γῆν] Perhaps reading ABBREV‘ as earth,’ for mm:
‘ in my fury.
κατήγαγον.
.
.
εἰς γῆν] There is apparently some confusion with ver.
6.
The Heb.
word for‘ blood’(literally ‘ juice,’ keeping up the figure) occurs only in these two verses.
B* omits εἷς γῆν.
4.
ἐπῆλθεν αὐτοῖς] Heb.
‘( is)in my’ ABBREV the Greek might represent ABBREV 83.
λυτρώσεως] Heb.
generally taken‘ of my redeemed ones':
but many, including Del.
and Cheyne, treat the plur.
as equivalent toan abstract term:
‘ of my redemption.’
With this Lxx.
substantially agrees, and also Vulg.
amm:’
om’:
meat.
5.
Cf.
lix.
16.
Hm] Heb.
‘ supported me’( ἐστηρίσατο, lix.
16).
The Greek verb seems to be equivalent in meaning to ins- tare.
6.
The middle clause,‘ and made them drunk in my fury.’
is omittedby Lxx.
( supplied in Luc.
cursives from Hexaplaric text, due to Th.
Symm.
).
Many authorities, including several Heb.
MSS.
, read ABBREV‘ shatter’for ABBREV‘ make drunk.’
If Lxx.
had read thus, it may be that the confusion between this verseand ver.
3, which might naturally πίω, explains the presence of κατέθλασα above.
αἷμα] As above, ver.
3, though A.
V.
and Vulg.
( sanguis.
.
.
virtutem) both change their rendering.
7.
ἐμνίσθην] Heb.
has the impf.
=future.
κριτὴς] Heb.
‘ abundance,’ ABBREV seeon ver.

divides the sentences differently from the Heb.
accents, and κριτὴςis hardlya possible rendering, in any case.

2, xxi.
2, c.
This verb is used with2 Kingsi.
1;
with εἷς, as1 Kings xii.
19:
often with simple accus.
, or absolutely, as here.
Heb.
has here‘ deal falsely’:
ἀθετέω also renders ABBREV‘ act treacherously’ or‘ barbarously,’ without regard for obligations or feelings:
and( generally with prepos.
) ABBREV‘ rebel.’
9.
ἐκ πόσης θλίψεως] LXX.
connect this with ver.
8, and possibly readD for 3 before the noun.
οὔ πρέσβεις] All MSS.
butA have the sing.
, i.
e.
ABBREV ‘ a messenger for ABBREV and the negative, with Heb.
text, which the margin directs to be readas 15‘to him.’
Most opinions are in favour of this latter:
‘ In all their distress He was’:
but a few follow the‘written’ text, and render,‘ In all theiradversity he wasnoadversary’:
less probably,‘ there was no real ﬁliction.’
Kay's note in favourofthe negative, Delitzsch's and’s against it, should be consulted.

Hitzig, Ewald, Del.
, and Prof.
W.
E.
Barnes make‘ people’the subject of the verb, and construe,‘ Then rememberedhis people the ancient days of’:
the chief objection to which is, that itisa little too ingenious.
Others have taken the phrase,‘ the Moses,’ i.

the deliverer,‘ of his people.

Μωσῆ]’s reading maybe intended forthegenitive case, which would be nearer to Heb.
as it is generallyconstrued:
‘ that causedthearm of his gloryto go attheright hand of Moses.’
LXX.

( Μωσῆ would regularly be genitive:

reads it, and theline overHmay have disappeared in A:

δι’ ἐρημοῦ] Heb.
‘ wilderness’ here seems mainly to imply open country:
cf.
Ps.

9.
καὶ οὐκ ἐκοπίασαν] Lxx.
supplies καί:
Heb.
has the simple imperfect with negative, serving asa circumstantial clause:
weariness is implied in the verb‘ stumble. ’
14.
καὶ ἐς κτήνη διὰ πεδίου] Heb.
has no connecting particle, and beginsanew comparison here, at least according to most authorities.
πεδίον] Heb.
‘ valley’or‘ cleft,’ word akinto‘ dividing’in ver.
12.
LXX.
however render elsewhere by πεδίον, as Josh.
xi.
17, xii.
7.
κατέβη] ln Heb.
, the subject of this verb is‘ beast’( sing);
Lxx.
transfer it to πνεῦμα, and couple the next verb by καί.
W] Reading untan,‘ gave him’ probably as ABBREV from ABBREV‘ lead. ’
50 Vulg.

Ἐπίστραψον] Heb.
‘ loolt,’‘ take notice.
πλῆθος] Often for Heb.
non,‘ sound’or‘ multitude,’ as xvii.
12 πλοῦτος is sometimes used;
both words in xxix.
5, and a variant reading inℵ of lx.
5.
Here the Heb.
idea, which is asin xvi.
II, is softened down;
έλέους being used for the supposed physical seat of compassion, the bowels(1 John iii.
17), and πλῆθος givinga different aspecttothe phrase.
ἀνέσχου] The personof this verb, and consequentlythe sense,are altered from Heb.
16.
ὅτι] The particleis ABBREV.

ῥῦσαι] Heb.

ἵνα is inserted, perhaps inducedby5 before‘a little,’ which might seem to suggest purpose.
δρονι] As though reading ABBREV‘ mountain’for Dy‘people’:
several commentators have approved this, principally because the verb is thought to require an object.
But see Deut.

24, 31(so Delitzsch).
οἱ ὐπεναντίοι.

ἀγίασμά σου] Omitted by RB, perhaps because their original( the original Lxx.
?) missed out from the first to the second ABBREV in Heb.
The clause, as supplied in AQV and almost allisnot marked asHexaplaric byQ, nor would its attestation suggest that:
yet it scarcely approves itself as belonging to the true Lxx.
here.
19.
τὸ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς] In Heb.
this goes with the following negative:
‘ never. ’
The particles ὡς, ὅτε are inserted, and ἡμᾶς is for a 3rd pers.
The Hebrew verse includes lxiv.
I, as dividedin LXX.

The connection seems to be close:
Del.

took ABBREV tobe from ODD, ‘ melt, ’ cf.
Ps.
lxviii.
2, and translated accordingly, τήκεται, and κηρὸς may beaguess for mp,‘ kindleth,’ or else these words may have been rendered conversely:
the order is in favour ofthe former view, but the versein the psalm, which atany rate probably accounts for προσώπου inA, may have affected the rendering here.
κατακαύσει] Heb.
‘ makes water to boil.’
Lxx.
omit‘ water.
perhaps losing sight ofD'D afterD' DDΠ, and prob.
read ABBREV for ABBREV( in which heatis not the notion implied).
τοὺς ὑπεναντίους] Supplied as objectto the verb, from the next clause.

There are differences of person in the verbs.
Lxx.
omit‘ him that rejoiceth.
' except that ἵλεος is supplied inafew texts in that place.
The end of the verse is also different;
Heb.
is obscure, and is literally,‘ in them long time, and weshallbe saved.
'‘ ln them'would most naturally mean‘in our sins,' and in that case it seems almosta necessity to takethe verb as interrogative.
LXX.
's ἐπλανήθημεν probably ABBREV for ABBREV see’s note, and cf.

The clauses are divided differently in Heb.

The phrase‘ thy holy’in Heb.
, does not occur elsewhere.
Vulg.

The difference is only that of’ εἰς κατάραν] Perhaps a free rendering of Heb.

B c.
read τοῖς πορευομένοις ὁδῷ οὐℵ* οὐκ ἀληθη, the later versions having ὁδῷ οὐκ ἀγαθῇ.
On the whole, AQ*'s reading, which is furthest from the Heb.

but the question isa nice one, most arguments being double- edged.

Possibly LXX.

ἐν τοῖς προθύροις] Heb.

viii.
11, the‘ one’ being the officiating hierophant, followed bythe worshippers,or surrounded by them:
“ in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah thesonof Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand.
”( Some tried to findthe name ofa heathen deityin the words, but this is hardly satisfactory.
) If the Heb.
margin be taken,‘ one’is feminine, ABBREV,.
which is interpreted as meaning one ‘ tree’ or êrah, in the midst of the garden.
The phrase‘ behind one,’ ABBREV ABBREVis to produce confusion:
some have suggested reading ABBREV ABBREV‘ one and another’;
or inserting ABBREV before as well as after ABBREV after another.
What Lxx.
read is hard to guess:
possibly ABBREV ABBREV ‘ benind a’ as Vulg.
has past ianuam.
LXX.

It is a question how far Delitzsch is calling in calling them the‘ primitive stock.’
Asiatic lonians would be those most nearly concerned with the East:
but on the passagein Homer, Dr Leaf( Companion to Iliad,p.

The title must here bea general one, including the Lokrians, Phthians, Epeians, and, of course, the Athenians.

Thcbas 584 μητρός τε πηγὴν τίς κατασβέσει δίκης Lxx.

The word ABBREV‘ prey,’ here takenby LXX.

The difficulty of εἰ μήν, which is somewhat hastily dismissedin my note, is that if‘ if,’ the meaning of the clause is the opposite of whatis wanted,and of what is givenby εἰ μὴ or ἦ μήν.
Moreover, μὴν does not seem to be used with εἰ conditional( or interrogative)in classical authors or inΝ.
T.
The MSS.
often show disagreement.
The latest view is to consider εἷ μὴν a varietyof ἦ μὴν;
Blass, in hisN.
T.
Grammar( Mr’stranslation)prints εἴ μήν, and so does Prof.
Moulton, whose words(p.
46) are:
“ The complete establishment of εἴ μὴν by the papyriis an interestingconfirmationof the best uncials.
Despite Hort( p.
151) we must makethe difference between εἶ μήν and ἦ μήν strictlyorthographical after all, if the alternative is to suppose any connection with εἰ, if.
”I should.
upon this view, which almost certainly the right one, have said that εἷ μὴν“ is hardly possible’( am- pt as an equivalentto ἦ μήν:

Α reads ἐμαλακίσθη, but on general principles the reading of the great body of MSS.

ἀπέστραπται( Cf.

I return tothe subject below, Grammatical Note, § 6;
meantimeI venture on theprovisionalopinion that,where each tense has not its own proper force, some approximation or overlapping takes place:
the perfect approaching the aorist in meaning, but that aorist itself having in the Lxx.
a somewhat extended force, which renders the approach easier.
In x.

ADDITIONAL NOTE ON THE GRAMMAR AND STYLE OF THE LXX.
§ 1.
There is not yet, so farasI know, any work in English which deals mainly and directly with the grammar and style of the GreekO.
T.
The student has still to depend principally upon such books as deal withHellenistic Greek generally, and with the lexicology and grammar of theN.
T.
Beside Janaaris' Historical Greek Grammar, whose range is too widefor our immediate purpose, and theN.
T.
Grammars, whose period does not coincide, we can now turn toa chapter in Prof. ’
s Introduction to toO.
T.
in Greek( Part Il.
chap.
IV.
);
very valuable so far asit goes,but reduced by the neces- sities of space and proportion to an outline sketch.
Selections from tlze Septuagint, byF.
C.
Conybeare and StG.
Stock, contains a short practical surveyof the grammar, which will meet some but hardly all the’s needs.
When a grammar of the LXX.
does appear it will necessarily deal, for the sake of completeness, with many points which are interesting, especially for the light thrown upon philology, comparative and historical;
but are not immediately important to readers Whose desire is to use the Greek version continuously.
To these, the actualoccurrence ofaform or construction, however unclassical, is itsownexplanation in practice, provided that they can grasp its meaning.
Asa rule, the most pressing question is whether a doubtful sentence in the Greekis to be interpretedbythe guidance of the Hebrew, or by the ascertained rules and practice of Greek, classical or Hellenistic.
To decide this, either every such sentence must be noticed, or very care- fully reasoned principles must be collected and laid down.
Neither of these things can be done here, nor can even an outline be attempted.
Only a few roughly assorted remarks can be put together.
§ 2.
Many points, both of accidence and syntax, can butbe registered;
they will hardly perplex the reader, or,if they should, he must turnfor guidance toa translation — the Revised represents standard opinions on many points— unless he can findhe wants inLiddell and Scott, Prof.
Sophocles' Lexicon of Byzantine Creek, or theN.
T.
lexicons and grammars.
In any case, no trouble need be caused by varieties of form:
such as εὐθὴς for εὐθύς, τρανὸς for τρανὴς, σωτήριον, ὅρκος, δυσίν( which serves to markthe death Ofthe Dual), may, λήμψεται, ἐλάβοσαν, and the like:
πλοῦτος neuter, the plurals of οἱρανὸς( as xxxiv.
11, xliv.
23) and γῆ( as 2 Kingsxviii.
35 xix.
11, Ps.
xlix.
11):
τοίνυν fist in the clause( iii.
to, v.
13, xxvii.
4 xxxiii.
23), ἐὰν for ἂν after relatives:
tense- forms such as φάγομα( xxix.
1), with φάγεσαι( lit.
16), ἐκέκραξα( see onvi.
2),’w’ yxataav( lxvi.
20), and even εἰλημμένος.
xi.

κύκλῳ used almost asa preposition, vi.
2, ix.
18, εἰ and μὴasinterrogative particles,the latter extended by comparison with’s Greek, while ποῖος interrogative(l.

) scarcely goes beyond it:
ὃς for ὅστις, as xlii.

πῶς ex- clamatory,as xiv.

xxviii.
17, Numb.
xxiv.
5, Ps.
lxxxiii.
1, cxix.
97 where the more classical ὡς appears.
§ 3.
The article is generally used very much as in Attic:
its omission before βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων, vii.
20, xxxvi.
15, c.
might seem anaIOgous to that of βασιλεὺς alone for the Persian king, in Herodotus(v.
1, ἃς.
) and Thucydides( 1.
18, c.
):
but it is also omitted in the casee.
g.
of Ahab and Benhadadin1 Kings xxi.
The tendency seems to be decidedly towards omission;
before nominatives used as voca- tives, as i.
to, and occasionally with the subject, asi.
21, though this is more generally retained, as ix.
7, xi.
10, cf.
xiv.
26;
and particularly before participles, as, apparently,in viii.
14, xxvi.
2, 3, xxx.
17 xxxiii.
15:
sometimes these participles have ἄνθρωποςin sing.
or plur.
, as viii.
15, xxv.
3;
contrast xxxii.
2.
On its use with οὗτος and ὅδε see below, 5.
Other loosenesses may be noticed atv.
21, xxix.
20.
The article is often repeated in such arrangements as τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτοῦ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ τὰ χρυσᾶ, ii.
20, cf.
iii.
22, ν.
15, 16, xxviii.
1, 4, c.
;
but on the other hand, phrases like ὁ τοῦ θεοῦ οἶκος, oi ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἐγκαθή- μενοι, are rarely found( though see ix.
14, lix.
21);
cf.
ii.
2, ix.
9, but almost any page will show instances.
§ 4.
Nouns need cause little difficulty, apart from forms, spellings,and vocabulary.
The neuter plural is constantly used witha plural verb, as wellas with the singular, with seeming indifference:
the MSS.
very often vary.
On the otherhand, xviii.
2, 3 contains what maybe suspected tobea case of the Schema’ ndarz’ cum, and, if so,a very strong one:
cf.
Moulton, Grammar ofN.
T.
Greek, p.
58.
Here we may note the accusativeof respect, still in force, as in xi.
15, xxxvi.
22 and the accus.
witha passive verb, xxxvii.
2.
We may wonder whether the accusative can possibly be used instead ofa genitive,x.
32, and in apposition toa genitive( indeclinable)in xxxvii.
38! Both passagescan be construedasthey stand, but still the doubt occurs.
On ὃν τρόπον, used commonlyasa conjunction,see on vii.
2.
τοῦτον τρόπον is foundin Attic, but less commonly than the dative.
Adjectives, being relatively scarce in Heb.
, are not very common in the LXX.
's somewhat literal rendering.
The indeclinable πλήρης most probably to be found in lxiii.
2, where see note.
§ 5.
Pronouns decidedly show some blunting of the classical usage.
Ἀὐτὸς in oblique cases is excessively frequent as 3rd pers.
pronoun, and this, corresponding to mere suffixes in Heb.
, has often been noticed asa disfigurement of the LXX.
's style.
Even in the nominative, the emphatic force is sometimes hard to perceive,e.
g.
i.
2 xxxiv.
17, xlii.
17;
xxxi.
2 seems more pointed, and lxiii.
9, 10 difficult to determine.
Ὅδε and itscompounds have nearly retired in favour of οὗτος, and the distinction between them is blurred :
the phrase τάδε λέγει.
.
.
is common, and not to be distinguished from οὕτως λέγει( or εἶπεν)in meaning, though MrH.
St J.
Thackeray detects by its usea different’s hand in Jeremiah( journal of Theol.
Studies, Jan.
1903).
A few instances of ὅδε occurinthe Pentateuch, as Numb.
xvi.
42, Gen.
xliii.
21, where it is used with the article, as οὗτος is,e.
g.
in xxv.
7, xxvi.
1.
The article is also regularly used with ἐκεῖνος·
in the phrase ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ii.
20, ἃς.
The demonstrative usually stands last in these cases, contrast ix.
14, 15, xiv.
26.
Ὅδε occurs in Isaiah atany rate once, lx.
8;
also Jerem.
xlviii.
Xlviii.

Τοιοῦτος occurs, lviii.

, Introduction,“ Or.
Methods of Rendering.
” The aorist seemsto be used withfull of meaning;
there are comparatively few cases in which the‘ gnomic’ use, with those of the‘ immediate past’ and‘ indefinite cannot be madeto cover the ground;
but sometimes evena liberal use of these explanations hardly satisties Leaving aside the question how best to render into English, such tensesas εἶδον, vi.
5;
κατίσχυσεν, xxiv.
20;
ἐπένθησεν, xxxiii.
9;
ἀπέστησαν, xxxiii.

16, present difficulties which are seldom felt in reading the classical Attic authors.
Many other aorists are found which, though notin themselves impossible, are difficult in consideration of their context and probable meaning.
In Isaiah, the future causes little difficulty:
it may have sometimes been wrongly chosen by the translator, but his intention is seldom doubtful.
ln clauses after ὃν τρόπον itis, however, awkward.
The idea seems not so much to represent the Heb.
imperf.
, which is not always foundin the original, as to assimilate the tense to the corresponding clause.
Most instances of the perfect in lsaiah are natural enough;
and the tense is fairly common:
but see above on liii.
5 for cases where it occurs in parallel clauses with the aorist.
From Prof.
Moulton 's discussion of the matter( Grammar ofN.
T.
Greek, p.
140 foll.
) we see thatthebest modern authoritiesare inclined to recognizethe possibility oftheaoristic use oftheperfectin someN.
T.
writers, accepting them, however, with extreme caution.
Prof.
Moulton himself limits them, apparently,to afewin Revelation,and three instancesof ἔσχηκα, asaspecial form, in’s Epistles.
This ἔσχηκα, with ἀπέσταλκα— for whichsee Acts vii.
35, 2 Cor.

17, Exod.
iii.
13— 15, lsai.
certain forms not simply reduplicated, to which Mozley( p.
148) draws attention, are suSpected of aoristic force.
Mozley also points out the use of the perf.
in titles of Pss.
xciiii.
, xcvi.
, after ὅτε, andafew others, such asB's εἴρηκε in2 Kings vi.
7.
ὁπότε and ἡνίκα,rather than ὅτε, seem tobe used in titles of Psalms with unmistakable aorists:
cf.
in Isaiah, xvi.
13, xx.
1, xxxviii.
9;
but this is not invariable, see lxiii.
19.
As to aoristicperfects in the LXX.
, we haveto remember ﬁrst, that the translation Is not homogeneous:
and Prof.
Moulton says( p.
143),“ We are entirely at libertyto recognise such perfects in one writer and deny them to another, or to allow them for certain verbs and negative the class asa whole.
” Secondly, the question may be whether it is the form of the one tense or the meaning of the other that prevailed;
or rather, whether itwas not made easierforthe perfect to be used where we might have expectedan aorist,by the aorist having already extended its limits, so as almost to encroach upon what was the territory of the perfect.
( The perfect form, that is, is perhaps regainingfor the tense someofthe ground which the aorist had previously extended its meaning to cover.
) On the couplingof the two,as in liii.
5, we may again quote Prof.
Moulton, speaking(p.
143) of“aorist and perfect joined with καί and with identical subject.
When the nexus is so close, we might fairly suppose it possible for the tenses to be contaminated by the association, even wherea perfect would not have been used aoristically by itself.
” Hence no surprise need be felt at the coordinate aor.
and perf.
in our Isaiahpassages, while on the other hand there seems to be no instance of an isolated aorist perfect in the book.
There are, it is true, some where the aorist, according to some of its uses in the book, would appear equally possible.
Compare e.
g.
ἤκουσεν, vai.
8, with ἀκηκόασιν below, ver.
19, or ἠρήμωται,i.
7, with ἠρημώθη, xxiv.
10;
also xlvii.
13 with lvii.
IO.
According to my view, as expressedin Vol.
I.
“ On Methodsof Rendering,” the extended use of the aorist in Isaiah is largely to its being the’ choice as the normal tense to represent the Heb.
perfect.
The rest of the prophetic, lyric, and poetic passages of theΟ.
Τ.
are, so far as I can see, not unlike Isaiah in this respect.
Plain narrative, introducing the help of a continuous story or context, stands ona different footing.
The rendering of the LXX.
into English has of course difficultiesofits own, of which these tenses form not the least important.
The English translator has to determine what theGreektranslator meant, and to judge( see §1) how fartorender in the lightofthe original, and how far by the ordinary rules of the Greek language.
As a hostagehas been giventofortune in Vol.
1.
, no more need be said here.
But on the question of the aorist and perfect especiallynit must be remembered that the use of tenses is nota fixed quantity, either as between two languages( though with obviously corresponding forms) or between two stages of one language.
The English tenses themselves have undergone much change in usage.
Again, the French past tense with avoir(I avoid the terms‘ definite’and‘ indefinite’) corresponds, evidently,in form totheEnglish tense with‘ have,’ and jaimaionthe whole toI loved;
but the usage often differs considerably.
I choose,almost at random,a quotation from MM.
Erckhmann- Chatrian's Waterloo, chap.
ix.
:
” Cette montre.
.
.
je Lai regue du prince ène pour une action éclat.’
And one fromRacine( Athalie, Act II.
Sc.
V.
l.
511 foll.
)“ Mais lorsque revenant de mon trouble funesteJ' admirais sa douceur, son airnoble et modeste, Ƒai senti toutà coup un homicide acier.’
Could an Englishman possiblyuse the tenseI have.
.
.
in sentences such as either of these?We must therefore be preparedto ﬁnd eventheGreek aorist and perfect occasionally approximatingin their meanings, and frequently, at one or another stage of the language, impossible to render into English each by a single tense- form of our own.
The tenses in other moods than the indicative( as the perfects κεκλήσθω, iv.
1, κεκακῶσθαι, liii.
7) need not detainUS:
on’u’ xpa’yov see noteonvi.
3, comparing Moulton,p.
147.
The participles are for the most part ordinary:
the active perf.
participle( in form)occurs roughly speaking about forty times in Isaiah;
but of these more than half are instances of πεποιθώς, which is frequently used with tenses of εἰμὶ to form equivalentsfor finite forms.
ἰσχυκότες, viii.
9, is unexpected and may be considered awkward, but cannot be fairly called irregular.
Apart from πέποιθα, βεβούλευμαι( iii.
9, xiv.
24.
, 26, 27, xlvi.
10, 11) and πέπαυται( xxiv.
8, xxvi.
to, xxxii.
to, xxxiii.
8) are the commonest ﬁnite perfects;
the required meaning, of course, accounting for this.
τοῦ with infin.
mostly stands for Heb.
ABBREV with infin.
;
very occasionally forD with infin.
( privativc sense), which is oftener τοῦ μή.
Notice the doubt as to the insertion of μὴ in viii.
16, xxv.
2( Heb.
ABBREV and ABBREV with nouns), and the variant τὸ with infin.
, apparently consecutive, in xxi.
3.
( In thephrasesΖῶ ἐγώ, xlix.

§ 7.
On adverbs there is little to say.
Prof.
Moulton( p.
105) alludes to theN.
T.
use of ἀνὰ and κατὰ distributively:
Lxx.
also use ἀνὰ with numerals, asl Kings xviii.
13, but these, being mostly inde- clinables, give no clue to the case.
The double adverbial phrase, ταχὺ κούφως ἔρχονται, ν.
26, is noticeably awkward.
§ 8.
Prepositions show more departure from classical standards.
The niceties of Attic, as in other matters, are blurred.
For instance, ἐπὶ τὸ ὅρος τοῦτο, XXV.
6, is much nearer in meaning to ἐπ’ ἄκρων τῶν ὀρέων, ii.
2, ἐπὶ κούφοις, xxx.
16, or the neighbouring ἐν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ, xxv.
7, than to ἐπὶ τὸ ὅρος Σιών, xxix.
8( leaving xxxi.
5 aside as ambiguous).
Similarly πέποιθα is followed by ἐπὶ with acc.
or with dat.
, and ἐν with dat.
, almost indifferently;
see xxxi.
1, xxxii.
3 xxxiii.
2, & c.
Ἐν and εἷς seldom( if ever)show signs of but the former has extended its uses, in the endeavourtodo the workofHeb.
ABBREV Ἀπὸ is inclined toencroach upon ὑπὸ, xiii.
19 Β, and to lose its shade of difference from ἐκ on some occasions;
but readings sometimes vary, as in viii.
19, cf.
xxix.
4.
The dat.
is seldom found after prepositions other than ἐν and ἐπί, though it might have seemed difficult to do without πρός( cf.
Moulton, p.
104 foll.
).
Prof.
Moulton shows that in theN.
T.
the dative would be the scarcest case after prepositions but for the predominant ἐν:
in the Lxx.
it might be said generally that certain usesofthe dative are abundant, but the number of constructions in which the case is commonly used is smaller than in classical Greek.
§ 9.
Conjunctions and particles have somewhat shifted their force and proportion.
ὅτι often represents Heb.
ABBREV and it is sometimes difficult to know whether it represents‘ that’or‘for’:
μὲν and δέ, their regular antithesis, have all but disappeared;
δέ alone isnot very common, and μὲν occurs twice in the book, vi.
2, where δὲfollowingis doubtful, and xli.
7, where it is absent.
On ὅτε, ὁπότε, ἡνίκα, see above, § 6.
Relative particles or conjunctional phrases seem increasingly common:
ἕως οὗ, ἀφ’ οὗ,with perf.
xiv.
8, with aor.
xliii.
4, διότι, ὃν τρόπον:
cf.
perhaps ἐφ’ ἅ(??), xxv.
11.
On εἷ μὴ ἤκουσας;
xl.
28, see note there.
It certainly seems simplest to take it as interrogative.
The apodosis is sometimes marked by καὶ, as in lviii.
13, 14, where itis uncertain which καὶ has this office;
which perhaps comes from the use of Heb.
ABBREV though this is not foundin either of these instances.
I cannot recallan instance of δέ similarly used in the book, but its com- parative rarity in any sense makes this not surprising.
ἀλλὰ and πρὶν are oftenfollowed by ἤ, MSS.
varying much.
The meaning is hardly affected, unless some slight emphasis is to be under- stood.
Οὐ and μὴ presentno very marked peculiarities.
Μὴ introducinga hesitating assertion or suggestion may possibly occur xxviii.
17, where see note.
Οὐ may be seenusedto negativea specitic phrase after ἵναc.
subj.
in viii.
20, and cf.
x.
15, where however the phrase οὐχ οὕτως isa special weaknessofthe Lxx.
With participles οὐκ occurs, as in xli.
11, 12, lvi.
11, lix.
10;
μή, less frequently than mightbe expected,as in xxix.
12.
.
In relative clauses, οὐκ, as in lxv.
20;
μή, as in lviii.
11.
Interjections, as amatterof usage, differ from Attic.
φεῦ and αἰαῖ are replaced generally by οὐαί, see oni.
24.
Occasionally ὦ is used, as in Habak.
ii.
9, 15, 2 Kings vi.
5.
See also such passagesas Judg.
xi.

§ 10.
But the general colouring of the style remains the chief peculiarity of the LXX.
's Greek.
It is not so much that the constructions are unclassical, as that mostclassical arrangements arerare or absent.
Owing to the short co- ordinate sentences, which follow the original, the devicesof Greek syntax haveall but disappeared, while mostof the methods of expression recur so frequently as to be bald and monotonous in any case, and, if not agreeable toclassical usage,to have the appearance and effect of mannerisms.
Thus the optative disappears in historic consecution, leaving its work to the subjunctiveand indit ative, as in lvii.
8;
it also grows rare after εἷ, and, when it is found, the potentialclause does not match it;
see xlix.
15, and cf.
Moulton, p.
196.
On the other hand it is used with excessive frequency to express Wishes, Job iii.
3— 9, Ps.

;

7— 15.
There are, again, instances of anacoluthon, beyond,or different from,the Attic practice, and probably mainlydue to the almostcaseless Hebrew of the original:
cf.
Vol.
I.
p.
40.
Thus λέγων or λέγοντες is used to connecta’s statement withthenarrative introducing it, though neither agreeing with the grammatical subject nor even referring to it:

Special Hebraisms have been noted where they occur;
their combination with the featureshere briefly mentioned, with the addition ofa vocabulary and ideas not those of Attic Greek, produce a marked difference in general effect.
The scope ofa remark made by Prof.
Moulton( p.
76) might be extended:
“ The Greek translator, endeavouring to be as literal as he could, nevertheless took care to use Greek that was possible, however unidiomatic.
” This,I‘ he’or‘ they’ constantly did, both by choice and of necessity;
thinking it the paramount dutytobe literal, and not caring for the usages of literary Greek.
But if they were not masters of Attic by inheritance or acquirement, neither were they devoid of native gift of language, nor of some conception ofa’s duty, nor of skill to carry it out.
