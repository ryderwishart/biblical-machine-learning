Along with disputations, forewarning situations are some of the most typical in the gospels. There are ten forewarnings in Matthew, five in Mark, five in Luke, and five in John. These situations are private discussions insofar as they are always involving socially close participants who are both active (at least at the outset of the situation). The activity is invariably a conceptual one by the close of the situation, and almost every instance is both private and involving institutional authority.

These private conversations do not tend to unfold according to formulaic stages such as one might expect when ordering food at a restaurant, listening to a fairy tale, or observing courtroom proceedings.

      "[(Document(page_content=\"Social-Situational Context:\\n\\nThis word is part of the passage 'Peter's Confession and Christ's Answer'\\n  - This passage is a Forewarning/Private Discussion situation, which can be described in typical terms as follows: While this situation type could be rightly described as private discussion, it is worth noting that in all but a couple of these private discussions the activity could be further specified as predicting or warning, and thus forewarning tends to be a feature of these private discussions. Along with disputations, forewarning situations are some of the most typical in the gospels. There are ten forewarnings in Matthew, five in Mark, five in Luke, and five in John. These situations are private discussions insofar as they are always involving socially close participants who are both active (at least at the outset of the situation). The activity is invariably a conceptual one by the close of the situation, and almost every instance is both private and involving institutional authority. These private discussions tend to be strongly conventional, meaning institutional norms play a key role, whether the institution involved is realized by the teacher–disciple agent dyad (in almost all of the situations), or else some other relationship such as the chief priests and Pharisees speaking with their servants. Despite the conventionalized relationships these situations entail, the situations are not, on average, either procedural or flexible in nature. These private conversations do not tend to unfold according to formulaic stages such as one might expect when ordering food at a restaurant, listening to a fairy tale, or observing courtroom proceedings. At the same time, there are tendencies that arise from the regular pressures of conventionalized relationships, such as letting the authoritative party have the final word, the giving of instructions even if the activity is not practical (resulting in situations that are neither determining nor influencing, on average), etc. These situations can also be described as a forewarning, however, insofar as almost every situation involves prediction and usually a warning about future consequences.\\n  - It begins with the following situational features:\\n    - Asserting goals involve stating or affirming beliefs, claims, or opinions, often in a declarative manner.\\n    - Close social distance refers to situations where participants have a close relationship or are familiar with each other.\\n    - Institutional control refers to situations where one participant or a group of participants hold authority or power over others.\\n    - Conceptual field values involve abstract or theoretical activities, such as theological or philosophical discussions.\\n    - Private publicity refers to a situation where participants actively oppose a particular stance or outcome.\\n    - Allying value orientation predisposition refers to participants who share the same views or are supportive of each other's positions.\\n    - Spoken medium refers to communication that takes place through speech, either in face-to-face conversations or through audio recordings.\\n    - Phonic channel refers to communication through sound, such as spoken language or music.\\n    - Dialogical refers to situations with two speaking participants, such as a dialogue or conversation.\\n    - Addressee-more-active process sharing refers to situations where the recipient of the message is more actively involved in the communication process, such as asking questions or providing feedback.\\n    - Constitutive language role refers to situations where language is the primary means of carrying out the activity or achieving the goal.\\n    - Interpersonal activity focus pertains to the social interaction between participants, focusing on their roles, relationships, and attitudes.\\n  - During the passage, the situation gained the following features: projecting, logical, addressee-more-passive and lost the following features: interpersonal, addressee-more-active, asserting \\n    - Situation features that were gained:\\n      - Projecting goals involve making predictions, prophesying, or discussing future events or possibilities.\\n      - Logical activity focus involves reasoning, argumentation, or explanation, where participants engage in activities that require logical thinking.\\n      - Addressee-more-passive process sharing refers to situations where the recipient of the message is less actively involved in the communication process, such as listening or reading without providing feedback.\", metadata={'source': '/Users/ryderwishart/genesis/itemized_prose_contexts/LUK 9:21.txt_Social-Situational.txt'}), 0.9054334759712219)]\n"
