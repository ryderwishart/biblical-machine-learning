      "{0: {'number': 0, 'title': 'Narration/Account', 'description': 'Narrations or accounts are material situations, and so they involve first-order activities, which they convey descriptively, rather than interactively. In describing material events, these situations tend to background the activity, facilitating the progression of narrative time. The relationships in these accounts tend to be unconventional, with distant participants who employ relatively flexible language in their discourse. The political significance of these situations tends to be minor, with little to no opposition regarding values. Discourse also tends to be mostly one-sided, usually with one participant offering direction or information to another who remains largely passive. Based on these aspects of narrations, I had initially predicted that the gospel frameworks would be most similar to this situation type. However, this did not prove to be the case. The purpose of narration is not predictable. For example, in the case of “The Annunciation to Joseph and the Birth of Jesus” (Matt 1:18–25), the purpose is at least in part to determine the legitimacy of the child Jesus. In “The Resurrection of Christ” (Matt 28:1–10), the purpose is at least in part to instruct the women at the tomb to go tell the other disciples to meet the risen Jesus in Galilee.'}, 1: {'number': 1, 'title': 'Denouncement', 'description': 'The final situation type observed in my data set is the denouncement situation, in which a figure of unclear social status eventually denounces some authorities. These situations are semiotic and may be either descriptive or interactive, insofar as the situation comprises mostly speaking, and yet most of the speaking is done in response to the events described at the outset of the situation. The relationships in these situations tend to be unconventional, in both cases because they begin with an unclear picture of social hierarchy (John the Baptist, for example, does not fit easily into the existing social strata). The language may tend to be procedural. Both exemplars involve language beginning as ancillary to the activity but ending as constitutive. In both cases, as well, the conclusion of the situation involves a projecting monologue about values from the speaker directed at institutional superiors. The political significance of this situation type is challenging (both exemplars have an opposing heteroglossic disposition throughout), and in regard to mutuality, the linguistic activity is lecturing. The purpose of a denouncement is to influence. Examples of denouncement situations in the gospels include “The Ministry of John the Baptist” (Matt 3:1–12) and “The Enmity of the Pharisees and Christ’s Answer” (Matt 12:14–30).'}, 2: {'number': 2, 'title': 'Forewarning/Private Discussion', 'description': 'While this situation type could be rightly described as private discussion, it is worth noting that in all but a couple of these private discussions the activity could be further specified as predicting or warning, and thus forewarning tends to be a feature of these private discussions. Along with disputations, forewarning situations are some of the most typical in the gospels. There are ten forewarnings in Matthew, five in Mark, five in Luke, and five in John. These situations are private discussions insofar as they are always involving socially close participants who are both active (at least at the outset of the situation). The activity is invariably a conceptual one by the close of the situation, and almost every instance is both private and involving institutional authority. These private discussions tend to be strongly conventional, meaning institutional norms play a key role, whether the institution involved is realized by the teacher–disciple agent dyad (in almost all of the situations), or else some other relationship such as the chief priests and Pharisees speaking with their servants. Despite the conventionalized relationships these situations entail, the situations are not, on average, either procedural or flexible in nature. These private conversations do not tend to unfold according to formulaic stages such as one might expect when ordering food at a restaurant, listening to a fairy tale, or observing courtroom proceedings. At the same time, there are tendencies that arise from the regular pressures of conventionalized relationships, such as letting the authoritative party have the final word, the giving of instructions even if the activity is not practical (resulting in situations that are neither determining nor influencing, on average), etc. These situations can also be described as a forewarning, however, insofar as almost every situation involves prediction and usually a warning about future consequences.'}, 3: {'number': 3, 'title': 'Assignment', 'description': 'Assignment situations are very similar to charge situations (see immediately below), though with some marked differences. An assignment situation typically involves mutually well-known parties that are relatively close to one another. The assigning activity most often is directed from an institutional authority, such as a teacher or Rabbi, to a subordinate such as a disciple or servant. Sometimes peers may give an assignment to one another, as in the case of the soldiers’ dividing Jesus’ clothing at the crucifixion (John 19:23). Because of this typical institutional authority relationship, assignments are conventional situations which are, on balance, more procedural or formal in nature rather than flexible in the way they unfold. Assignments almost always relate to some practical activity toward which the participants share the same value orientation. In other words, the participants are usually hierarchically organized allies in the task at hand. Assignment situations may involve determining activity (trying to sort out what happened, will happen, or is happening, etc.) just as often as they involve influencing activity, where one party tries to motivate the other to take some kind of action.'}, 4: {'number': 4, 'title': 'Charge', 'description': 'A charge situation is typified by unconventional relationships and flexible discourse. Where assignments involve close participants often part of an institutional hierarchy, charge situations involve distant participants who are not institutionally stratified.

Charge situations are strongly material or first order and also tend to be influencing.'}, 5: {'number': 5, 'title': 'Appraisal', 'description': 'An appraisal situation is semiotic and interactive. One party appraises another ongoing activity, and thus the appraisal is a second-order activity with the first-order activity as its subject matter. All three exemplars, accordingly, begin with language playing an ancillary role in the situation, and one of the three is neither semiotic nor material. Appraisals involve conventional relationships, where a disciple ventures an interpretation of the first-order activity and is rebuked by his rabbi. The situation is more procedural than flexible, insofar as, in each case, an appraisal is made by the subordinate party and then responded to by the authoritative party. In each case, the offered appraisal is negative, and it is rejected by the rabbi, so the value orientation is opposing. There is a tendency for these situations to be lecturing rather than discoursing, since both parties are asserting their viewpoint without necessarily opening up dialogical space for the other. There is also a tendency for these situations to have influencing as their purpose.'}, 6: {'number': 6, 'title': 'Questioning', 'description': 'Questioning situations are semiotic, involving second-order activity. They are interactive, retarding or pausing the flow of narrative time. They have a slight tendency to involve conventional relationships insofar as they involve interaction between strangers of apparently equal social status (as opposed, for example, to a stranger asking a socially distant authority for a favour). Questioning between equals involves linguistic flexibility, as neither party is required to follow formulaic patterns to elicit information. The participants oppose one another, but they are nevertheless better characterized as discussing rather than challenging, since the onlookers are disinterested and thus there is little at stake in the situation so far as the questioners are aware. The participants tend to be mutually active in the activity, and the purpose of the situation is to determine something.'}, 7: {'number': 7, 'title': 'Controversial Action', 'description': 'Controversial action situations are material situations with first-order activity. They are interactive, with unconventional relationships given the kind of activity undertaken by at least one participant. They tend slightly toward more procedural language, involving some kind of censure over the activity, and there is a slight tendency toward discussing rather than challenging, since a number of parties may engage in discussion about the controversy without necessarily opposing or challenging the authority of the one undertaking a controversial action. These situations tend to involve one-sidedness, even when multiple parties speak—each is offering a pronouncement in some sense, without necessarily engaging in a mutual exchange with any other party.

'}, 8: {'number': 8, 'title': 'Disputation', 'description': 'The disputation is one of the most characteristic situations in the four gospels. There are five disputations in Matthew, ten in Mark, three in Luke, and seven in John. Disputations are semiotic interactions. They involve second-order conceptual activities, where typically active conversation partners make opposing assertions, chiefly about values. These conversation partners often relate conventionally, usually having hierarchical social status differentiation with the backing of institutional authority behind one party. Onlookers are not neutral but instead are invested in the value positions being disputed. The language used may be flexible or procedural. While almost all of the exemplars involve opposition in regard to heteroglossic disposition throughout the situation, the political significance of the activity may be either discussing (where some topic or value is at stake) or challenging (where someone’s identity, status, or even safety is at stake). There is a tendency toward low mutuality or reciprocity in the linguistic activity, typically lecturing rather than conversing or discoursing. Put in more concrete terms, in the gospels Jesus often disputes value orientations with the teachers of the law, the Pharisees, or the Jews more generally.'}, 9: {'number': 9, 'title': 'Vilifying Story', 'description': 'Vilifying stories are strongly semiotic, as the second-order activity involves telling a story in written style (as if the story had been prepared beforehand). They are also strongly descriptive, and yet the description does not move narrative time forward, since the story being told is an embedded narrative. The relationships involved in these situations tend to be unconventional, as the speaker, whatever his social status relative to his hearers, commands their attention and drives the situation forward. Vilifying story situations involve procedural language and a strongly challenging heteroglossic orientation. These situations are primarily driven by one speaker, and their purpose slightly tends to be determining rather than influencing. Both exemplars of this situation type are non-mutating; they begin with opposition and end with it, and the story simply brings into focus the dynamics of the conflict and the significance of that conflict as envisioned by the speaker. In the gospels, vilifying stories include “The Parable of the Marriage Feast” (Matt 22:1–14) and “The Parable of the Vineyard” (Mark 12:1–12). '}, 10: {'number': 10, 'title': 'Rebuke', 'description': 'Rebuke situations are semiotic situations, descriptive rather than interactive, and they typically involve unconventional relationships and flexible language. These situations are challenging, rather than discussing, since the activity involves opposing value positions. There is a low degree of mutuality in a rebuke, as the rebuked participants do not tend to respond, since they are not necessarily capable of responding. In one example, multiple cities are being rebuked for their reception of Jesus. The purpose of these situations slightly tends to be determining. In the gospels, examples of rebuke situations include “The Woe upon the Galilean Cities” (Matt 11:20–24) and “Jesus Condemns the Teachers of the Law” (Mark 12:35–44). '}, 11: {'number': 11, 'title': 'Organizing', 'description': 'Organizing situations score as first-order or material rather than semiotic activities on the concreteness continuum, as participants speak about concrete plans regarding how they will order or execute either another stage in the same situation or else some other situation (perhaps an embedded or interrupting situation). Organizing situations are first-order situations insofar as they involve direct instruction-giving and discussion about material activity rather than semiotic activity, even if that activity is relatively remote (always in the future). Though organizing is a first-order activity, it is nonetheless a foregrounded activity that tends to pause the narrative at least so long as planning or organization is in progress. Because organization involves, in some sense, the giving of orders, there are usually conventional relationships at play, and issuing ordered instructions tends to be more procedural than flexible insofar as one party is often the issuer while another party is the executor of orders. Organizing situations may be either discussing or challenging, but tend to be neither very strongly. Due to the practical needs of organization or planning, there is a degree of conversational interaction or mutuality in organizing, and the purpose is typically to influence, though in a few cases the purpose can better be described as determining. For example, in “Easter Morning” (John 20:1–18), determining what happened to Jesus is a major aspect of the activity, and in “The Preparation for, and the Celebration of, the Passover” (Luke 22:7–38), the significance of Jesus’ instructions require elucidation.'}, 12: {'number': 12, 'title': 'Judicial Examination', 'description': 'Judicial examination situations are first-order situations, where a participant is arraigned, questioned, sentenced, and perhaps summarily punished in the form of beatings (all the exemplars in this data set begin as linguistically constituted situations and end with language only playing an ancillary role). These situations are interactive, as participants ask and/or answer questions. The relationships between participants are, perhaps paradoxically, unconventional. This is not because there is no institutional authority involved—all of the exemplars in this cluster involve institutional authority—but it is rather because the nature of the defendant’s status and precise relationship with this institutional authority is in question and under deliberation. Furthermore, witnesses who bring accusations against the defendant are not necessarily related to the defendant in a conventional way. Despite unconventional relationships, there tends to be linguistic rigidity to the activity, as usually only one party is being subjected to an array of questions or accusations. In terms of the tenor politics of the activity, one party tends to be challenging the other, and as the challenged party complies by responding in an expected manner, a general opposition results between the parties. There is no strong tendency with regard to the mutuality of the parties’ contributions to the situation. The purpose of these situations is to determine.'}, 13: {'number': 13, 'title': 'Public Execution', 'description': 'Public execution situations are semiotic situations insofar as they include clear, second-order activity relating to a first-order execution. Though there is in fact a strong material component to these situations, the semiotic or second-order nature of the activity is evidenced in the inclusion of graphic written communication directly asserting the identity of the accused, as well as public taunting, jeering, or other kinds of value-laden language. In this sense, public executions are similar to public spectacle or novelty situations. Public executions might be considered in some sense a kind of spectacle, though with differences in politics, thematics, and logistics. Public executions do not tend to be strictly interactive or descriptive. These situations also tend to include unconventional relationships, insofar as there is little linguistic involvement on the part of the authorities (except perhaps in writing), and the numerous involved parties that make up members of the public onlookers tend to have different kinds of relationships with the criminal(s) being executed. The language involved in realizing the activity is strongly procedural (it might be described as an outlier in the data) because of its use of a written sign at the outset of both exemplar situations describing a practical activity. The language used to realize the activity tends to be discussing rather than challenging, as the authorities dispassionately state the identity of the condemned and onlookers passionately accuse or defend him. There is a high degree of mutuality as numerous parties contribute to the linguistic activity, and the purpose of this activity is to influence—the determination is already complete as far as the participants are concerned. There is a public execution situation in Matthew, “The Crucifixion and Death of Christ” (Matt 27:31–56), and another in Mark, “The Crucifixion and Death of Christ” (Mark 15:21–39).

Presumptive interactions are second-order activities, where meaning-making is the main function of the situation. In these situations, there is interaction and thus foregrounding of the activity, though the relationship between participants may be conventional, unconventional, or neither—participants are always socially distant from each other. With this distance, there is in fact a higher degree of flexibility afforded to participants, which results in one participant holding an opinion, and in some cases making an assertion of some kind, that needs correcting by the other party. For example, in “The Annunciation to Mary” (Luke 1:26–38), Mary notes that she is a virgin and asks the question, “How can this be?” Mary presumes the angel’s predictive announcement cannot come to pass because of the facts of the situation, but the angel corrects her by giving her new information. While there is usually some form of value opposition in these situations, there is also alignment in some cases. These situations tend to be discoursing, and they are always dialogical. These situations typically begin with one point of view which is later corrected.

At the same time, their purpose is neither to influence nor to determine. They are non-mutating situations, meaning they begin and end with the same situational parameters intact. It may be sensible to say the specific purpose of these situations is to inform neutral onlookers. These situations are descriptive, and so they progress narrative time. They involve unconventional relationships (perhaps where relative social status is unclear or debatable), and flexible language. They strongly tend toward overall alliance, and thus the activity is better described as discussing rather than challenging. The activity is driven by one party, and so is better described as lecturing rather than discoursing.

Rather, these examinations are more like an assessment a police officer might make to determine a driver’s sobriety or the questions one might ask of a prospective job applicant (perhaps asking them to complete some kind of job-related task). In terms of political significance, these situations may involve either discussing or challenging, though typically one participant drives the activity by giving directions. The purpose of the activity is to influence the directed party into undertaking certain actions.

Thus, the public spectacle situation involves second-order activity. Public spectacles are interactive, and so they in some sense “slow down” the passage of time being construed. The participants in a public spectacle do not relate by way of conventional relational patterns (they are usually strangers), and the discourse is flexible insofar as onlookers are usually left scratching their heads as to the meaning of the events just witnessed. The political significance of a public spectacle is not challenging, since onlookers or participants tend to ask questions or make assertions without necessarily being closed off to alternative explanations. These situations involve multiple parties who contribute to the activity of being or evaluating the novelty, and so these situations tend to involve mutual conversing rather than lecturing. Though the effect of a public spectacle is to leave onlookers wondering who or what it is they just witnessed (in this sense they are trying to determine something), the purpose of the situation is nevertheless to influence, since one participant seeks to get another to do something, and the impact of this action is a novelty to onlookers.'}, 18: {'number': 18, 'title': 'Correction', 'description': 'Corrections are semiotic situations that slow down narrative time to construe an interaction wherein one party corrects the other with a contradicting assertion for the benefit of the onlookers.

These situations tend to be mutual rather than one-sided, and the purpose of the activity is to influence.

They end with assertions from new speakers about values or the significance of what is going on as constitutive of the activity. These situations are first-order situations, though there is semiotic activity at the conclusion. They may be either interactive or descriptive, and tend to involve conventional relationships (Jesus and his disciples, in this case) and procedural language (where the authoritative figure issues instructions to subordinates, in this case). With regard to political significance, there is an overall tendency toward alliance or agreement on the values at stake. While both exemplar situations end with multiple speakers, there is nevertheless a tendency for one-sided lecturing in these situations, and the purpose of the activity is to influence.

They begin with some kind of instruction and end with a projected example. Because this projected example is yet another order from the discourse realizing the situation (i.e., a text embedded in the discourse of the participants), the descriptiveness of the situation does not mean that narrative time is passing—it passes relative to the timeline of the embedded illustration story but it does not pass in this sense in the illustrated lesson situation. These situations have a written style, and therefore are more procedural than flexible despite having no typical inclination toward either conventional or unconventional relationships. The heteroglossic significance of an illustrated lesson is to challenge or oppose, and there is a slight tendency to be discoursing rather than lecturing, as questions or prompts from the audience may arise over the course of either one or several illustrations. The purpose is neither to determine nor to influence, since either can be accomplished by the lesson conveyed through illustration. There are two illustrated lesson situations in Luke, “Miracles of Healing and Preaching” (Luke 6:17–49) and “The Unjust Judge” (Luke 18:1–8).

Conflicts are interactive, and so they differ from situations like a rebuke (see below). Like rebukes, however, they tend to pause the progress of the narrative (though they may begin or end with a description of some kind of progress, such as when the crowd arrives to arrest Jesus in Luke 22:47). Conflicts typically do not require high relational formality between participants. While in many cases institutional authority may be involved in the conflict, the only situations that score as conventional situations in this cluster are “The Capture of Jesus” (Mark 14:43–52) and “Jesus Arrested” (Luke 22:47–53). In all of the conflict situations, even in these two arrest situations, it is clear that both parties can afford to oppose the will of the other party or share information to whatever extent they desire. In fact, in most of Jesus’ conflicts with the Jews, he appears to be in command of the situation as a prophetic speaker despite the weight of institutional authority behind those he is in conflict with. Conflicts are always public (at least by the end of the situation), however, and so there remains a level of linguistic proceduralism in terms of the kinds of speech acts each party is expected to enact. Conflicts, as implied by their designation, tend to be situations involving value opposition. Typically, one party is challenging the other in some respect. While conflict situations are interactive in terms of the conflict itself, half of them are monological. Participants are, to some extent, vying for dominance in a conflict, and so conflicts do not tend to involve cooperation.

Instead, one participant does nearly all the speaking while other ongoing activities are backgrounded. Orations tend to be informal, and the speaker may enact nearly any kind of speech act so long as the other participants continue to listen. Orations in the gospels slightly tend to be more challenging than discussing, indicating orations do not always go over well with all listeners in these accounts. There is also a slight tendency for these situations to be lecturing rather than discoursing or conversing, but this tendency is slight because orations are often either responses to inciting questions other participants have posed, or else the oration prompts a response or remark from onlookers. Overall, orations are not specifically tailored to either influence or to determine something; both purposes are facilitated by orations.'}, 25: {'number': 25, 'title': 'Accommodation', 'description': 'An accommodation situation involves first-order or material activity wherein one party accommodates the request of another party as a diplomatic gesture or concession. It is interactive between more than two parties, involving conversation about the need for accommodation as well as the accommodation itself, spelling out its accommodating significance. There is also first-order discussion about how to go about accomplishing the accommodating act. The relationships in this situation type are unconventional, but the language is procedural as it involves giving a series of instructions in order to fulfil some specific requirement or expectation. There may be a degree of opposition as the problem is noted, and there is a slight tendency toward lecturing or one-sided, authoritative speaking in response to the need for accommodation. The purpose of accommodation is, perhaps surprisingly, not to influence but rather to determine, and both exemplars involve, as noted, a discussion about the significance of such an accommodation. Thus, the purpose of an accommodation situation is in order for the participants to discern or determine something. Based on the strongest tendencies this pair of situations displays, these situations are interactive determinations regarding some material activity as its subject matter. There is one accommodation situation in Matthew, “Christ Pays the Temple-Tax” (Matt 17:24–27) and one in John, “The Marriage at Cana” (John 2:1–12).

They have no tendency in terms of either their relational formality, their linguistic formality, or their mutuality (whether lecturing or discoursing). They do, however, have a tendency to be influencing in purpose and a strong tendency to be challenging in terms of their heteroglossic orientation. Both of these situations mutate from being practical instruction about the substance or action of the situation (i.e., field-related meanings) to being conceptual projection about values, and thus the function of this situation is to challenge one party’s authority, which elicits a prediction about negative future events (perhaps consequences of the value orientation that issued the challenge). Challenge situations are similar to disappointing requests, but the former begins with opposition and concludes with a negative prediction whereas the latter begins with ostensible alliance between the parties and concludes with a corrective assertion. These differences indicate that Jesus interpreted the significance or social function of the requests differently in both types of situation. When a disappointing request is made, Jesus interprets the request as the result of misunderstanding and wrongly directed aims, which he ultimately corrects in private conversation with his disciples. When a challenge is made, Jesus interprets the challenge as a designed interference with his mission, and he openly and publicly rebukes the challengers, warning them of coming judgement (though he does this cryptically in John 2:19). A challenge is thus designed interference that, in response, brings about public rebuke and warning. There is one challenge situation in Matthew, “The Sign from Heaven and a Warning” (Matt 12:38–45) and one in John, “The Purging of the Temple and Its Results” (John 2:13–25). '}, 27: {'number': 27, 'title': 'Disappointing Request', 'description': 'This situation type involves, to some extent, parties who are at cross purposes. In both exemplars, another participant has a request for Jesus, but Jesus, whether or not he complies with the request, challenges, criticizes, or outright rebukes the implied or explicit value position from which the request comes or which has contributed to the request. These situations are material or first-order, but not strongly, since the activity shifts from a practical one to a conceptual one in both cases. These situations are interactive, with more than one party making active contributions in each case. There is also a tendency to involve conventional relationships, as in both cases a favour is requested of a social superior and reflected on with close, institutional subordinates. These situations tend to begin with distant participants and end with close participants, and so they typically involve more flexible language. In both cases, the conversation begins on allying terms and ends with value opposition, arrived at through conversation or discoursing means as opposed to just lecturing. These situations may have either a determining or influencing purpose. There is one disappointing request in Luke, “The Healing of the Epileptic Boy” (Luke 9:37–45), and one in John, “Christ the Bread of Life” (John 6:22–71). Both of these examples show contextual similarity especially in terms of the way the situations mutate: both shift from being practical, involving a request speech act (e.g., δέομαί σου ἐπιβλέψαι ἐπὶ τὸν υἱόν μου, ‘I implore you to look on my son’ [Luke 9:38]) to being conceptual situations (e.g., ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου μέλλει παραδίδοσθαι εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων, ‘the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into people’s hands’ [Luke 9:44]). Both likewise shift from instructing to asserting, from having an allying value orientation to an opposing one, from non-institutional/neutralized hierarchy to institutional hierarchy, and from involving socially distant to socially close participants. '}, 28: {'number': 28, 'title': 'Disagreement', 'description': 'Disagreements are interactive, semiotic activities that nevertheless typically progress the surrounding narrative as events transpire about which a disagreement arises. They are unconventional in terms of relational formality, but they are also procedural in terms of linguistic expectations. This is because the kinds of speech acts participants can enact are in part controlled by their interlocutors. Essentially, initiating speech acts constrain the kinds of responses the other participants can enact. If someone commands someone else, they are, at the very least, posing as the controlling or dominating party in the exchange. The respondent may enact a discretionary response, in which case they will mutate the situational roles accordingly. In situations where opposing statements are made, the expected response (acknowledgement—perhaps not directly realized in the situation but only implied by the behaviour of the initiating participant) maintains the established opposition, and so a fairly procedural set of exchanges may ensue in a disagreement. Similarly, questions elicit answers, but since questions are open or expanding acts, the respondent is free to offer a discretionary response or otherwise oppose the initiator without mutating the situation—adding further to the procedural nature of the disagreement. For these reasons it can also be noted that disagreements are not necessarily discussing or challenging in their heteroglossic orientation; both orientations lend themselves to a disagreement depending on the openness of the initiating speech acts involved. If one participant initiates a disagreement, the other may oblige them. Disagreements are not strongly mutual, however, and thus the gospels do not construe protracted disagreement situations—most disagreements in these collections either escalate or repeat under other circumstances. The purpose of a disagreement is to determine something, often the relative status of the participants (e.g., Σὺ εἶ ὁ Βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων; ‘You are the king of the Jews?’; Luke 23:3) or the proper construal of the thematic formation under discussion (e.g., ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ, ‘the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head’ [Luke 9:58]).'}}\n"

Lexical features\\nThis data is useful for identifying the meaning of a word across all of its various contexts.\\n- class: ὁ is a det,\\n- gloss: meaning \"-.\"\\n- lemma: The lemma form of this word is ὁ,\\n## 2. Syntactic context and function\\nThis data is useful for identifying the meaning of a word in a specific sentential context.\\n- case: Grammatical case: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, or vocative: accusative,\\n- gender: Grammatical gender values: masculine,\\n- number: Grammatical number: singular,\\n- OpenText syntax (useful for identifying all of the grammatical choices that led up to this word, such as whether it is part of a derived \\'entity\\' definition or a nested \\'turn\\' or a particular kind of speech act):\\n  This word has the following syntactic selection features:\\n  - #articulation: The indicate exploits the most general type of indication (i.e. ὁ) as a derivational marker (i.e. \"the article\"), which makes it possible to indicate an experience as conspicuous while also defining it using some other explicit definition. The resulting indication is expressed by an articular substantive.\\n  - #predicating: The move combines a generalization (a predicate) with an explicit introduction of an instantiating entity (a subject). This is the most frequently selected speech act type. Notably, it activates a number of additional modal systems related to interpersonal meaning that are not activated in the simpler speech act types (which are purely ideational).\\n  - circumstance: A wording explicitly construes some (informational or spatio-temporal) environment (e.g. where, when, why, how, etc.).\\n  - complete: The process is explicitly construed as complete. The verb employs an aorist or perfect tense stem.\\n  - differentiated: The intrinsic definition isolates a single dimension along which experiences can be compared and contrasted with one another.\\n  - gender_tbd: The gender of this wording has not yet been properly analyzed. (Fall back to morphological description of this wording)\\n  - grouped: The wording explicitly construes a logical set of experiences, even if it only makes explicit one member of the set. Structurally, this means that a junction is created, even if only one path is further specified (e.g. a negative particle or an adverbial καί might mark a wording as removed/added to a set, even if there are no conjoined wordings in the surrounding sentence).\\n  - indicated: The differentiation explicitly indicate an experience as conspicuous (i.e. it is deictic). This signals that the experience is somehow prominent relative to relevant alternatives.\\n  - instantiator_construal: The predication explicitly construes whatever entity instantiates a predication\\'s core generalization. It is expressed with a dependent wording that serves as an explicit grammatical subject.\\n  - internal_orientation: The proposition offers a representation that is explicitly marked as something that cannot be observed in reality but can only be \"observed\" internally (e.g. by memory or imagination). If the predicate is non-synchronic, it is expressed using a verb with a secondary personal ending (i.e. aorist indicative, imperfect indicative, pluperfect indicative, or optative). In the indicative, the verb normally takes the augment as a prefix.\\n  - number_tbd: The number of this wording has not yet been properly analyzed. (Fall back to morphological description of this wording)\\n  - objectifying: The subjective participant of the event is explicitly focused on some experience (i.e. an objective participant). In traditional terms, the verb is \"transitive.\"\\n  - positive_operator: This path in the conjunctive junction employs a conjunction (or \"focus adverb\") as a logical operator in order to explicitly add experiences to a conjunctive set (e.g. \"and Peter\" or \"They also survived\").\\n  - progressive: The positive operator explicitly marks an addition as progressively expanding a set. Other implied members may be explicit in the co-text or they may be presumed. The operator is expressed by δέ (or one of its compounds).\\n  - speech_act: The move advances a situation using speech (as opposed to some other modality). Almost every move in the NT is a speech act of some kind.\\n- Treedown syntax: This word is part of the following sentence:\\n\\n        \\n          s: Abraham[Ἀβραὰμ]  \\n          v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n          o: -[τὸν]  Isaac[Ἰσαάκ], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Isaac[Ἰσαὰκ]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Jacob[Ἰακώβ], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Jacob[Ἰακὼβ]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Judah[Ἰούδαν]  and[καὶ]  the[τοὺς]  brothers[ἀδελφοὺς]  of him[αὐτοῦ], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Judah[Ἰούδας]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Perez[Φαρὲς]  and[καὶ]  -[τὸν]  Zerah[Ζαρὰ]  \\n            +: out of[ἐκ]  -[τῆς]  Tamar[Θάμαρ], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Perez[Φαρὲς]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Hezron[Ἐσρώμ], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Hezron[Ἐσρὼμ]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Ram[Ἀράμ], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Ram[Ἀρὰμ]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Amminadab[Ἀμιναδάβ], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Amminadab[Ἀμιναδὰβ]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Nahshon[Ναασσών], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Nahshon[Ναασσὼν]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Salmon[Σαλμών], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Salmon[Σαλμὼν]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Boaz[Βόες]  \\n            +: out of[ἐκ]  -[τῆς]  Rahab[Ῥαχάβ], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Boaz[Βόες]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Obed[Ἰωβὴδ]  \\n            +: out of[ἐκ]  -[τῆς]  Ruth[Ῥούθ], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Obed[Ἰωβὴδ]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  Jesse[Ἰεσσαί], then[δὲ]  \\n          \\n            s: Jesse[Ἰεσσαὶ]  \\n            v: begat[ἐγέννησεν]  \\n            o: -[τὸν]  David[Δαυεὶδ]  \\n              apposition: the[τὸν]  king[βασιλέα]. \\n## 3. Discourse context\\nThis data is useful for identifying the way a word contributes to a larger discourse context.\\nThis word functions within 1 discourse features (these are useful heuristic interpretive annotations that tell you about the nature of the proposition a word is in):\\n- Main clauses is defined as Main clauses are the top-level clauses in a sentence. They are the clauses that are not embedded in other clauses.\\n## 4. Social context\\nThis data is useful for giving top-down clarification about what is going on in a passage, which helps narrow down ambiguities in more low-level data.\\nThis word is part of the passage \\'The Genealogy of Christ\\'\\nThis passage is a Forewarning/Private Discussion situation, which can be described in typical terms as follows: While this situation type could be rightly described as private discussion, it is worth noting that in all but a couple of these private discussions the activity could be further specified as predicting or warning, and thus forewarning tends to be a feature of these private discussions. Along with disputations, forewarning situations are some of the most typical in the gospels. There are ten forewarnings in Matthew, five in Mark, five in Luke, and five in John. These situations are private discussions insofar as they are always involving socially close participants who are both active (at least at the outset of the situation). The activity is invariably a conceptual one by the close of the situation, and almost every instance is both private and involving institutional authority. These private discussions tend to be strongly conventional, meaning institutional norms play a key role, whether the institution involved is realized by the teacher–disciple agent dyad (in almost all of the situations), or else some other relationship such as the chief priests and Pharisees speaking with their servants. Despite the conventionalized relationships these situations entail, the situations are not, on average, either procedural or flexible in nature. These private conversations do not tend to unfold according to formulaic stages such as one might expect when ordering food at a restaurant, listening to a fairy tale, or observing courtroom proceedings. At the same time, there are tendencies that arise from the regular pressures of conventionalized relationships, such as letting the authoritative party have the final word, the giving of instructions even if the activity is not practical (resulting in situations that are neither determining nor influencing, on average), etc. These situations can also be described as a forewarning, however, insofar as almost every situation involves prediction and usually a warning about future consequences.\\nIt begins as a n o   e m b e d d e d   d i s c o u r s e situation\\n## 5.

The goal is to preserve as much of the original meaning, context, and nuance as possible, while also ensuring the translation is accessible and understandable to the target audience.\n",

    "Translator's Tips for MRK 1:5!4\n",
    "Lexical Features: The word 'αὐτὸν' is a pronoun meaning 'him.' Be aware that it can have different meanings in different contexts. The syntactic context is potentially needed to clarify the functional significance of its case. Make sure your translation reflects the pronoun’s masculine gender, and singular number appropriately for your target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactic Context and Function: 'αὐτὸν' plays the role of 'Direction' in the sentence, which is indicated in part by its accusative case, which construes a very general relation of some kind. In addition, the word is affected by its participation in the sentence, as indicated by the use of a lexeme that is always in the middle voice. Also, the word is part of a circumstance (informational or spatio-temporal environment) and is reiterated, which means it refers to \"the same\" experience again, expressed by the intensive pronoun αὐτός. Ensure the translation reflects the complex syntactic role of this word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discourse Context: 'αὐτὸν' is used in a main clause. Make sure the translation reflects the fact that this word is not part of a subordinate clause or embedded speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social Context: The word appears in the passage 'The Ministry of John the Baptist,' a forewarning/private discussion situation. Pay attention to the overall tone and context of the passage while translating. The passage is neither procedural nor flexible in terms of the formality of its language, and institutional norms and expectations play a key role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultural/Encyclopedic Knowledge: The word 'αὐτὸν' falls under the semantic domain of 'Whom or What Spoken or Written About.' While this is a simple pronoun and is not likely a source of cross-cultural confusion, it is important to recognize the word is an intensive pronoun (often glossed 'self'), in which sense it differs from pronouns in many languages. Be sure to translate this word based on its functional significance, not strictly its decontextualized lexical meaning.\n",

      "  - elaborated: The definition includes dependent modifiers that serve to further elaborate the definition. These elaborating wordings (i.e. the modifiers) must express definition types that are more specific than the one expressed by the core (e.g. given a noun and an adjective expressing a definition, the noun must be analyzed as the core substantive and the adjective as an elaboration).\n",

Along with disputations, forewarning situations are some of the most typical in the gospels. There are ten forewarnings in Matthew, five in Mark, five in Luke, and five in John. These situations are private discussions insofar as they are always involving socially close participants who are both active (at least at the outset of the situation). The activity is invariably a conceptual one by the close of the situation, and almost every instance is both private and involving institutional authority. These private discussions tend to be strongly conventional, meaning institutional norms play a key role, whether the institution involved is realized by the teacher–disciple agent dyad (in almost all of the situations), or else some other relationship such as the chief priests and Pharisees speaking with their servants. Despite the conventionalized relationships these situations entail, the situations are not, on average, either procedural or flexible in nature. These private conversations do not tend to unfold according to formulaic stages such as one might expect when ordering food at a restaurant, listening to a fairy tale, or observing courtroom proceedings. At the same time, there are tendencies that arise from the regular pressures of conventionalized relationships, such as letting the authoritative party have the final word, the giving of instructions even if the activity is not practical (resulting in situations that are neither determining nor influencing, on average), etc. These situations can also be described as a forewarning, however, insofar as almost every situation involves prediction and usually a warning about future consequences.\n",

At the same time, there are tendencies that arise from the regular pressures of conventionalized relationships, such as letting the authoritative party have the final word, the giving of instructions even if the activity is not practical (resulting in situations that are neither determining nor influencing, on average), etc. These situations can also be described as a forewarning, however, insofar as almost every situation involves prediction and usually a warning about future consequences.\\nIt begins as a non-institutional-or-neutralized addressee-more-passive conceptual-ie-internally-oriented logical projecting spoken phonic monological distant allying constitutive on-someones-side situation\\nNon-institutional or neutralized control refers to situations where no specific participant or group holds authority or power over others.\\nAddressee-more-passive process sharing refers to situations where the recipient of the message is less actively involved in the communication process, such as listening or reading without providing feedback.\\nConceptual field values involve abstract or theoretical activities, such as theological or philosophical discussions.\\nLogical activity focus involves reasoning, argumentation, or explanation, where participants engage in activities that require logical thinking.\\nProjecting goals involve making predictions, prophesying, or discussing future events or possibilities.\\nSpoken medium refers to communication that takes place through speech, either in face-to-face conversations or through audio recordings.\\nPhonic channel refers to communication through sound, such as spoken language or music.\\nMonological refers to situations with only one speaking participant, such as a monologue or a soliloquy.\\nDistant social distance refers to situations where participants have a distant relationship or are not familiar with each other.\\nAllying value orientation predisposition refers to participants who share the same views or are supportive of each other\\'s positions.\\nConstitutive language role refers to situations where language is the primary means of carrying out the activity or achieving the goal.\\nOn-someones-side publicity refers to a situation where participants actively support a particular stance or outcome.\\n## 5.
