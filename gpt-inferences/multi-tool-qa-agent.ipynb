In Egypt and Babylonia vistas of history have been\\nopened to view that were undreamed of before exploration began. The same\\nis true for that part of the history of Palestine which antedates the\\ncoming of Israel. Information has also been obtained which illumines later\\nportions of the history, and makes the Biblical narrative seem much more\\nvivid. It is now possible to make real to oneself the details of the life\\nof the Biblical heroes, and to understand the problems of their world as\\nformerly one could not do. Exploration has also brought to light many\\ninscriptions in the various countries that confirm or illuminate the\\ntraditions, history, poetry, and prophecy of the Bible. The sands of Egypt\\nhave even yielded us some reputed new sayings of our Lord.', metadata={'source': 'theology/43070-0.txt'}), Document(page_content='It is the purpose of this book to gather into one volume the most valuable\\ninformation of all sorts that the excavations in Bible lands have\\nafforded, and to put it in such form that it may be of service to the\\npastor and Sunday-school teacher.
