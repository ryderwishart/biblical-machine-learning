        "\n",
        "This notebook exemplifies how to build a powerful question-answering system using OpenAI's Language Model (LLM), augmented with a specific knowledge database—in this case, the Bible. The aim of this combined system is to provide accurate responses to queries related to the Bible, as well as to demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs when combined with structured data sources, thus empowering them with long-term memory and specificity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main components of this notebook are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Building a Bible QA System**: A question-answering system specifically trained on the Bible is created. This involves vectorizing the Bible text and storing it in a Vectorstore database. The Bible QA system is built using the RetrievalQA method from the langchain.chains module, which leverages the power of the LLM to reason about and retrieve information from the Bible database.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Initializing an LLM Agent**: An LLM Agent is initialized with the Bible QA system as a tool. This allows the agent to utilize the Bible QA system when answering questions, essentially enabling it to \"remember\" information from the Bible and reason about it. The LLM Agent acts as a router and decision-maker, determining how and when to use the Bible QA system based on the input question.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Running Queries**: The combined system is then used to answer complex, multi-step questions related to the Bible. The LLM Agent's ability to perform multi-step reasoning is showcased, with the agent using the Bible QA system to answer individual parts of the question and then combining those answers into a final response.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook thus exemplifies the use of LLMs as a reasoning tool, enhanced by a specific knowledge database. This approach not only improves the accuracy of responses to specific queries but also provides the LLM with a form of long-term memory, allowing it to consistently access and reason about a large, fixed body of knowledge."
