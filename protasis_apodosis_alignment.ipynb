Hagner (1993) notes that this might as well be translated \"since\", as the devil is testing Jesus' obedience to the Father rather than questioning his identity. Q presents the subsequent command Jesus is being tempted to obey. The conditional as a whole amounts to a taunt or a challenge. Fong (2014: 30-31) discusses this as an example given by Young (1994) of a rhetorical conditional. That is, it is not being presented as a real condition, but the conditional is used for its logical connection in order to affect some other speech act, in this case \"manipulation\", according to Young. Fong, however, thinks it would be better classified as a \"challenge.\"</td>\n",

       "0  P presents a fact that the temptor knew to be true. The devil certainly knows Jesus' identity. Hagner (1993) notes that this might as well be translated \"since\", as the devil is testing Jesus' obedience to the Father rather than questioning his identity. Q presents the subsequent command Jesus is being tempted to obey. The conditional as a whole amounts to a taunt or a challenge. Fong (2014: 30-31) discusses this as an example given by Young (1994) of a rhetorical conditional. That is, it is not being presented as a real condition, but the conditional is used for its logical connection in order to affect some other speech act, in this case \"manipulation\", according to Young. Fong, however, thinks it would be better classified as a \"challenge.\"   \n",

Though highly unlikely, and though it did not come to pass, this was still a (remote) possibility when the devil spoke it. It was a real option for Jesus, though he did not take it. Unlike the two previous temptations, this one is a third class, using εαν with the subjunctive because ( according to Hagner 1993) it involves an actual unmet condition.   \n",

The connection between salt and discipleship is that, as Marshall (1978) puts it, \"a false form of discipleship may look like salt, but the gradual process of leeching leaves only a zestless pile of waste.\"  Nolland (2005) claims that discussions of how salt of the day may have lost its flavour are pointless, as the point being made is that such a thing would be \"bizarre and unnatural.\" It would be terrible for salt to lose saltiness because it is itself the thing that adds flavour to tasteless food.   \n",

Nolland, Hagner, and others agree that the righteousness Jesus discusses here cannot mean that he is actually commanding the disciples to live by the letter of the law as the Pharisees do (and to a greater extent, which is nigh impossible). \\nParaphrase (to avoid multiple negatives in languages without 'unless' or 'except'): For I say to you that only if you are more righteous than the scribes and Pharisees, will you enter the kingdom of heaven.   \n",

Hagner (1993) notes that this might as well be translated \"since\", as the devil is testing Jesus' obedience to the Father rather than questioning his identity. Q presents the subsequent command Jesus is being tempted to obey. The conditional as a whole amounts to a taunt or a challenge. Fong (2014: 30-31) discusses this as an example given by Young (1994) of a rhetorical conditional. That is, it is not being presented as a real condition, but the conditional is used for its logical connection in order to affect some other speech act, in this case \"manipulation\", according to Young. Fong, however, thinks it would be better classified as a \"challenge.\"</td>\n",

       "0  P presents a fact that the temptor knew to be true. The devil certainly knows Jesus' identity. Hagner (1993) notes that this might as well be translated \"since\", as the devil is testing Jesus' obedience to the Father rather than questioning his identity. Q presents the subsequent command Jesus is being tempted to obey. The conditional as a whole amounts to a taunt or a challenge. Fong (2014: 30-31) discusses this as an example given by Young (1994) of a rhetorical conditional. That is, it is not being presented as a real condition, but the conditional is used for its logical connection in order to affect some other speech act, in this case \"manipulation\", according to Young. Fong, however, thinks it would be better classified as a \"challenge.\"   \n",
